# Products: apple (red or green), orange, tomato (fruit; red), carrot (orange or purple), tomato (vegetable; green)
#
# fruit interpreter page: product refers to type of fruit or vegetable
#
# BUT product could be defined as items with a specific fruit/vegetable name and specific color (green apple is a different product from red apple) --> motivation: price and quantity constraints operate over color + product (name)
