regarding the fourth quarter of the that an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results if not the press release along with slide complementing are calmness today are available on our website www dot autism e dot com please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them
to begin this more now i think all autos owners across the company for their tremendous efforts during this past quarter our results for the physical fourth quarter work in line with our expectations and demonstrated steady improvement compared to our fiscal third quarter performance
delta results from month to month for relatively consistent however the northeast mid atlantic and mid western markets remain challenging underperformed the remaining parts of the country
as has been well documented following two consecutive mild winters
many of the categories are influenced by a harsh winter conditions continued to be pressured additionally the summer's temperatures were generally mild and our category performance and many of the hot weather categories where softer than we expected
overall we were encouraged to see our same store sales return to being positive despite these headwinds and market share data indicates that our share gains have been accelerating
we continue to make good progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently drop traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial business specifically we saw improvement in our commercial business and in our supply chain
total commercial sales increased five point nine percent compared to three point six percent in q three while our supply chain expenses de levered versus last year we began to make improvements in our network and are beginning to operate more efficiently again
during the quarter we opened a new distribution center and pascoe washington and expect open and additional dc in ocala florida in mid fiscal two thousand and eighteen
we also continue to be encouraged by the sales increases we expand from our mega hubs which typically service several hundred stores mhz act as distribution notes for hard different parts for their network stores
we also knew that helps during the quarter and expect to open approximately ten more in fiscal two thousand and eighteen the mhz further our ability to say yes we've got it to all of our customers
before getting hit a more detail about the quarter i want to share our perspective on some of the trends and headwinds that our industry and specifically our business has recently been experiencing
there are certain factors president today some macro and others that relate to actions we have taken as part of our long term strategy that had created challenges challenges to us delivering the same level of profitability growth that we had been delivering
we intentionally made the decision to invest in our business at an accelerated rate in the inventory
capital expenditures and operating expenses unfortunately as we increased our investment profile our sales have been slower than we would have thought due to poor for poor performance in several of our weather since the categories
and our multiple frequency of delivery initiative did not generate the benefits that we expected
additionally as our commercial program openings have slowed our overall commercial sales growth has declined as well
's like we say several other pressure points over the last year we have experienced accelerated pressure on wages significantly more than i have experienced in my nearly twenty three years of autism
some of this is attributable to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the balance and probably the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers
the regulatory changes
are going to continue as evidence about the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years additionally we are experiencing increase levels of shrink and our interest expense after years of lower rates is beginning to increase
the collective combination of these factors to significantly hampered our earnings per share growth
businesses
market trends and costs tend to run in cycles this year we unfortunately experienced a disproportionate amount of them working against us at the same time have made decisions to accelerate our investment profile
our management team has been in this business for a long time and we've been through many different cycles sometimes with head tailwinds and we have benefited from those
other times we've had headwinds we fought against him
ultimately we manage this business for the long term to provide great service for our customers and great opportunities for our auto owners ultimately delivering strong shareholder value
while some of the current expense had headwinds will remain for some period we know that this business model has excelled over decades we are confident with our autos owner s leading the charge that will continue to be the case
we operate in a terrific industry with very good fundamentals and we know our team could continue to deliver impressive long term performance
provide more detail in the quarter for the quarter sales increased three point three percent in our domestic same store sales were up one percent
june was our week period as it was much cooler than normal we continue to see our north eastern midwestern mid atlantic markets underperformed the balance of the chain as two consecutive mild winters continue to negatively impact these areas and particularly their hard part sales performance
this quarter these areas culp store sales were proximately forty basis below the other markets but are not to year basis at almost five hundred basis points this region of the country has materially underperformed the remainder
these regions represent roughly twenty five percent of our overall sales during the quarter we opened eighty five four new stores in the u s for the year we opened one hundred sixty eight stores and expect open approximately hundred fifty stores in twenty eighteen
commercial business expand about five point nine percent while opening ninety nine net new programs this quarter
our commercial growth accelerated from last quarter's three point six percent increase as we did not have the same headwinds in q four as q three from the income tax refund timing we didn't expect opened approximately one hundred five fifteen net new commercial programs for this new fiscal year
currently eighty four percent of our domestic stores have a commercial program during the quarter we continue to expand in mexico opening twenty five new stores we opened five new stores in brazil this quarter mark the most openings we've had an eighty one quarter in brazil
we've been doing business in brazil since two thousand and thirteen we expect open several more locations and twenty eighteen
we didn't open any additional mc branches this quarter while the domestic business dominate our sales mix and continues to be our primary focus we believe we have great growth opportunities outside of the u s as well
regarding the internet we experienced improving trends in web traffic shift the home sales and commercial online orders additionally are bilingual pick up in store continues to grow fairly rapidly
as we continue to make our online shopping experience better and better with ease of doing business improving we would continue to expect these various channels to grow materially faster than in store
our goal is to create a seamless only channel experience for our customers meeting them where when and how they want to interact with us
so you got it thing we remain focused on improving our closure rates meaning converting customer class for pricing and availability into silence in the spirit to satisfy our customers we are making ongoing billing system investments and enhancements to capture
data about our customers shopping patterns across all of our platforms both domestically and internationally we understand we have to be able to share information and process
seamlessly between our stores commercial shops phone and online experiences in order to meet all of our customers needs
we expect our loyalty program and its vast membership to continue to help us month customer shopping behaviors and gross sales materially in the future this will be a big focus for us and twenty eighteen
our primary objective remains going our domestic retail and commercial businesses we continued with our inventory availability initiatives in order to respond to the ever increasing challenge of parts demand in the industry
this past quarter we opened two additional mega locations and now have sixteen in operation
we are working diligently on the development of future sites and we expect to open up to ten more in twenty eighteen we continue to be very pleased with our megahit performance seeing them outperformed our initial expectations
additionally this past quarter we opened our night distribution center in washington state we expect open a florida dc by the middle of fiscal twenty eight thing
both of these new species will reduce transportation radius and therefore leaf times while also providing much needed additional capacity to our distribution network
each new distribution center costs us approximately sixty million dollars in capital and we infer some incremental operative operating expenses from pre opening activities and maturation i'd like to take a moment to go into more detail on our two inventory availability initiatives
these are two very different strategies addressing different opportunities multiple frequency of delivery is solely focused on improving the and stock levels for the excuse that our stock in our stores mega bottleneck
are focused on adding additional coverage to local markets meaning adding skews that would not have been available locally in our network before
regarding multiple pregnancies deliveries roughly twenty three hundred stores are saving more than one weekly delivery at the end of q three
however as we haven't been satisfied with the benefits the day we made significant changes in the fourth quarter to test differing scenarios to determine the optimal approach we move some stores from three times a week deliveries to one or two times a week deliveries
they also made some significant changes to our replenishment algorithms many of these changes are made in the middle of the quarter and we do not have sufficient consistent results yet to make any long term decisions but there are indications that are very encouraging to us
over the last two years as we quickly ramped up this initiative our cost substantially increased even beyond our expectations as we put tremendous pressure on our supply chain
during the fourth quarter some of the pressure began to subside and our cost increases began to abate we have let 's continue to work in front of us to determine the optimal approach and to regain the efficiencies we have historically enjoy
the second unwilling initiative is a mega megahertz store concept we are currently operating sixteen mega ships we continue to be quite pleased with what the mega have allow us to offer our customers
as a reminder these supersized autos owned stores carrier eighty to one hundred thousand unique excuse approximately twice what a hub store carries
they provide coverage both surrounding stores and other help stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis
our sales results this foreigner open mhz continue to exceed our expectations fo for retail and commercial
currently we have over four thousand stores have access to meghan of inventory
a majority are about two thirds of these four thousand stores perceived service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mhz more of them will receive this the same day and many will see that multiple times per day
we expect that ultimately outbreaks twenty five to forty mhz once the implementation is complete
the constraints on the speed with which we can open these is availability and location of real estate while an average out on location is just under seven thousand square feet of mega of as thirty thousand square feet or more
identifying and developing these locations in prime retail areas is challenging and takes time
while there are incremental calls to these rollouts we continue to feel these investments will provide a better customer experience and increase market share we did not experience meaningful noteworthy de leverage from this initiative term fiscal twenty seventeen
along with improving our local parks availability and assortment we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers provide our autos owners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement
and it sure we do it on a long term profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders
we will continue to stress the importance of going the extra mile to fill our customers needs regardless of how difficult the request and to this and in spite of a challenging physical twenty seventeen we continue to be shame is shared gainers over the course of the year
regarding mexico we opened twenty thousand new stores this quarter and ended the quarter with five hundred twenty four stores mexico now represents just under nine percent of our store base
hmm so very impressed by and proud of the business
team and culture of our team in mexico
in local currency mexico experience of solid quarter as for the first time since the u s election last november the value of the pace of the u s dollar strength and while we cannot guarantee anything when it comes to exchange rates we certainly hope twenty eight teams comparisons to twenty seventeen are more favorable
cells in our other businesses for the quarter were down point eight percent over last year's fourth quarter showing sequential improvement each quarter since the start of the year as a reminder are all data and e commerce businesses which includes auto zone dot com and auto anything makeup this segment of sales
this compares to bring down two and a half percent last quarter and reflects stronger perform
in all his own dot coms business in q four also as i previously mentioned we continue to see strong growth in our poundland pickup and stored sense this story in pickup in store encourages us to continue investing in our in store experience
we recognize that the majority of our site traffic is providing information to our customers prior to purchase and r e commerce platform represents an important part of our new channel experience
we see customers doing lots of research to learn about the products and how to the repairs
while these businesses are small for us at less than five percent of our total sales the ami channel experience is very important for the customer experience we will continue to invest in our e commerce platform
he continued aging of the car population we continue to be optimistic regarding transfer industry in both diy mbi f as new vehicle sales are near all the gas prices on average are quite low low miles driven continue to increase
the lower end consumer benefit the most from lower gas prices relative to income this trend remains encouraging
regarding our expectations for twenty eighteen if we return to a more normal weather patterns we expect sales performance to prove as a year moves forward
that has been well documented pertains harvey in remote
i had a material impact on a large portion of our country our thoughts and prayers go out to our impact impacted autos owners customers and all of those who have had to deal with the tremendous effects from these
storms
labs have been affected and we are in those markets donating our time and resources to help everyone that needs us
we had more than six hundred stores closed at some point as a result of these stores stones there are teams heroic efforts all of our floor for fact open in the middle of last week
we did sustained damage to some stores and are still determined the ultimate cost that will be recorded our first quarter but this time we do not expect those costs to be material
our efforts of now turn to hurricane maria which appears at a directly to puerto rico tomorrow
now let me review our highlights regarding execution evaporating theme for twenty seventeen gifts we've got it the key priorities for the year great people providing great service profitable growth in our commercial business leveraging the internet yes we've got it and leveraging ip
the region this past quarter under the great people provided a great service thing we continued with our intent
it 's on improving execution we're focusing on enhanced training to store level autos owners and increasing the share of voice regarding the ability
to say yes we've got it we had been aggressive on our technology investments in believe these investments will help differentiate us on a go forward basis we realise as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us
our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses the focus is on making sure autos owners can see inventory availability across the entire organization not just their story swiftly and accurately
question how susceptible our industry is to online encroachment and how big of a role that is playing in this current industry quote unquote solves spot clearly every sector of retail has been and like will likely will continue to be impacted by this new world
certainly study the ramifications and continue to do so
while some portions of our industry have migrated in small part to online we believe that the trustworthy advice elements combined with the sense of immediacy inflates as much more than most sectors of retail and to date that certainly has proven to be the case
i really felt this is how we substantially enhance our on the channel efforts to increase our competitive position with online and brick and mortar competitors
i think we should also try to put some definition around our industry and specifically higher sales performance in this soft spot
there's been tremendous dialogue around our in our industry sales performance in recent months
clearly our sales growth while positive has been lower than the last three years but our sales performance historically runs in cycles
we had one quarter and physical seventeen with a negative same store sales and the last time we had negative same store sales for the year was two thousand and five
same store sales have averaged one point nine percent over the last five years this year we ended the year with zero point five percent growth
one hundred and forty basis points below our reeks of average in physical twenty thirteen are same store sales were flat
by the way that followed a very mild winters so yes we see our sales softer than normal but feel within a normal band
and we have several contributors to the hundred forty basis points of departure from average two consecutive mild winters fallback cooler summer tax refund delays that never materialized and our sales
also the show to strengthen our commercial sales primarily due to lower new fragrance growth has slowed the overall costs increase
believe these items have been the drivers of our sales soft spot and not insubstantial online encroachment
it commercially open ninety nine net new programs during the quarter two hundred two for the year our expectations we will continue to open new programs in a range of one fifty and twenty eighteen as we continue to improve our product assortments and availability and as we make other fund must start commercial offerings
we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow as i said last quarter's earnings call we embark on a new strategic planning exercise focus solely on how we can profitably accelerate our market share growth in this very important sector of our industry
we are quite pleased that we have been in it has been able to in essence triple r sales and more than triple r profitability in commercial in the last nine years
we know we have to continue to involve our model to accelerate commercial sales to the next level we are assessing how we can more effectively provide merchandise to our customers and reduce friction across all of our customer touch points
commercial continues to be the most significant midterm growth opportunity for the company
as we currently have approximately three percent market share and we are determined to stanch substantially grow that over time
we should also highlights another strong performance return on the best capital as we were able to finish our fourth quarter at twenty nine point nine percent we continue to be pleased with this metric at as is one of the best and all apart heartlands retelling
however our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every instrumental dollar of capital that we deployed in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost to counsel
it 's important to reinforce that we will always maintain our dental disregarding capital stewardship
as a capital we invest is our investors capital before class the discussion over to bill doubts talk about our financial results i'd like to thank and reinforced how priest of we or our entire teams efforts to continue to meet and exceed
our customers once needs and desires are bullish on twenty eighteen sales potential because we have a great business operated by exceptional autism
now turn to tell the bill thanks good morning everyone to start this morning let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail commercial and international results for the quarter
but a quarter total of our sales which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses are mexico and brazil stores and our twenty six i m c ranches increased three point five percent
the trailing fifty two weeks ended total sales for others on store for one million seven hundred and fifty six thousand dollars
for the quarter total commercial sales increased to five point nine percent commercial represented nineteen percent of our total sales and grew thirty seven million dollars over last year's fourth quarter
this past quarter we open ninety nine net new programs versus one hundred and sixteen programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year
we now have our commercial program and four thousand five hundred ninety two stores or eighty four percent of our domestic stores supported by a hundred and eighty six
course virtually seven hundred and fifty of our programs or three years old or younger in two thousand and eighteen we expect to open again approximately one hundred and fifty new programs
bill mentioned just a moment ago we remain focused on growing this business we are committed to have a great sales team supplemented with stronger engagement of our store managers and district managers
we remain confident we will continue to gain market share with our commercial customers and we are encouraged by the initiatives that we have in place and feel we can further gross sales
as previously mentioned we are in the midst of a strategic review as we are supplementing are talented teams thoughts with those of a town of the third party giving us the opportunity to look at our business through a new and more objective lens
five teams have done a tremendous oryx and have developed a tremendous insights and hypothesis we haven't determined to where we go from here and once we do to chairman strategies and tactics they won't be role to the chain that is not the out as on way we will put manageable tests in place to determine if these are the right strategy
and we are highly confident that they will have to be tweaked and some will work and others want we expect to be testing and refining those to ask for a year or so and we will keep you informed us these progress
i mexico stores continue to perform well on a local currency basis we opened twenty five new stores during the fourth quarter
at the end of the quarter we had five hundred and twenty four stores in mexico we can expect to open approximately forty new stores in fiscal two thousand and eighteen
set in the past mexico's businesses them challenge throughout two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and seventeen by weakening face of foreign exchange rate relative to the u s dollar
fortunately this quarter the peso strengthened began and close to where it started the year this fluctuation can have a more meaningful impact on earnings as our store base continues to grow
mexico leaders team has done a terrific job managing the base pesos denominated business that regard in brazil we open five new stores and currently are operating fourteen stories are plans are to grow between twenty and twenty five total stores over the next few years
there is apparently rounds at an operating loss we are encouraged by the sales per store being generated we expect for sale will grow at store base and even surpass mexico store count over time and we can prove the operating model produces sufficient returns
partner for the quarter was fifty two point eight percent of sales down just two basis points the decline declining gross margin was attributable to hire supply chain costs associated with the current year inventory initiatives partially offset by higher merchandise margins
supply chain and trick expense had them higher and supported our inventory availability initiatives this past quarter showed tighter management of expenses we continue to feel we can manage these expense categories throughout fiscal two thousand and eighteen and our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit
... dollars and our total
segments
as dna for the quarter was thirty two point six percent of sales higher by fifty three basis points from last year's fourth quarter the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily due to be leveraging of occupancy costs and domestic store payroll driven by higher wage pressure

the higher expenses due to tenor and size of the bond issue this past april
debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was five billion eighty one million dollars are approximately one hundred and sixty million dollars more than last year's balance the four billion nine hundred and twenty four million
our adjusted debt level metric finish the quarter at two point six times see that dar while on any given quarter we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions
we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy
and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy
for the quarter our tax rate was thirty three point nine percent versus last year s q four thirty five point one percent i want to take a moment and read nine listeners of our first quarter adoption of a new accounting standard the new standard requires us to
recognize the tax benefit received from the gains

net income for the quarter was four hundred and thirty three point nine million dollars up one
seven percent over last year are diluted share count of twenty eight point four million was down four point eight percent from last year's fourth quarter
the combination of these factors twelve earnings per share for the quarter to fifteen dollars and twenty seven cents up six point eight percent over the prior year his fourth quarter

we repurchased two hundred and twenty seven million dollars of bottles on stock in the fourth quarter at quarter end we had eight hundred and twenty four million dollars remaining under our share buyback authorisation than our leverage metric was two point six times at quarter end i want to stress we managed to probe
credit ratings and that anyone metric the metric we report is meant as a guide only is the trading from has its own criteria we continue to view our share repurchase program is an attractive capital deployments strategy
to update you on our inventory levels in total went on a per store basis the companies inventory increased six point nine percent over the same period last year driven primarily by new store openings
editor their location the six hundred and forty four thousand dollars versus six hundred twenty five thousand dollars last year and six hundred and fifty three thousand dollars last quarter

they mentioned our continued discipline capital management approach
resulted in return on investment capital for the trailing four quarters of twenty nine point nine percent we have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed
our cost of capital now alternate back to build like you bill before i conclude i want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal two thousand and seventeen the here was clearly more challenging the recent years but our team continue to deliver some very impressive accomplishments and milestones
... and recognition of the dedication and passion innovation and commitment of our auto soldiers i want to highlight that our sales grew to a record ten point nine billion dollars this year
grew same store sales at zero point five per
we opened our six thousand stores and had the incredible on our to do so in our hometown of memphis tennessee
in may we opened our five hundred store in mexico a tremendous accomplishment by that counted two we restarted are stored development work as we enter the next phase of testing in brazil and we expanded to fourteen stores in and around sao paulo

most importantly our customers are visiting our website increasingly accelerated rates and using that race
artist to inform their in store visits
unfortunately two thousand and seventeen mark the year we broke our ten year double digit quarterly e p s earnings street and while that was disappointing it is equally important to recognise the incredible
the street represented deep analysis to understand the key drivers of our profitability change while some of them work sales related the larger impact came from increasing costs
we made decisions to increase our investment profile and some of those
that's haven't yet borne fruit specifically the multiple frequency of delivers at the same time we had a disproportionate amount of changes that were working against us
increased wages and ...
interest expense and alive our focus is to deeply understand the key drivers of our business and manage those factors that we control overcome macro factors will work for you and against you in fiscal two thousand and seventeen
of those times that they were disproportionately against us

this formula has been extremely successful over the last thirty eight years and we continue to be excited about our future i would like to open up the call for questions
thank you we will now begin the question and answer session at today's conference and to ask a question
press stars fall they number one on your phone and near any codename when prompted your name will be required to introduce your question to cancer so question press star fall read a number two as their of police limit yourselves
to ask two questions
our first question is coming from sef sigman credit suisse
okay good morning my question is around the commercial strategy know you are in the midst of the strategic review right now but what do you think is the biggest driver of big gap today versus your competitors is availability of the services of brands
or is it really just awareness in developing those relationships
and then the second part of the question is i guess i'm just wondering what are some of the potential outcomes of you and include actually an acceleration in des thank you
it's like you said for the question unfortunately i think it is too early hits premature for us to get into those specific details were looking at all those individuals factors
talk about whether its availability
passing or service model how do we work with them digitally and on and on and on there's a lot of different we are looking at leaving no stone unturned but at this point in time it's premature for us
really cost about where we see those improvement opportunities bill giles mentioned in our remarks it also once we decide what we are going to go but we are going to have to go tested put it in marketing the what works and tweak things along relates i think it is going to be a year or so before we really have uh
solid game finally say here's what we're going to go do and what calls
it will be will have an increased investment potentially certainly but i think it's too too early for us to even put any kind of guardrails around that
you did see an improvement in the commercial business this quarter growth to pass quarters even while reducing your frequency and you also mentioned that you can your market share gains are accelerating so
key just help us better understand what do you think is driving that we are that market share be coming from and is it retail and commercial was a religious commercial thanks a lot of different things and that question let me try to jump in first you know we grew our commercial business at five point nine percent
that is clearly substantially over with them
it is growing so that makes us happy
five point nine five point nine percent also is not at our aspirations for health rapidly we want to grow this business we have a three percent market share and we would like to grow at six significantly more than five point nine which is why we are in the midst of the strategic review
he also mentioned something about the fact we grew up this quarter over the last quarter of one of the reasons and i mentioned in the prepared remarks q three had a big dividend for the tax reforms that we thought we would get in q three that never materialised
i think it was more the anomalies
for if i did mention that you felt like multiple frequency as delivery would be a headwind fourth growing the commercial business and that was
and uh a lot of people were concerned about after last call and i look to address it for a second
multiple frequency of delivery is replenishing the stuff the merchandise that in the stores today one of the reasons why it has not been as successful as we hope is because particularly in the commercial business are coming
so drivers as they don't have that part available in illness store they run to the store closest to them and still service that demand i don t think that slowing down our multiple frequency of delivery has been a meaningful headwind to our commercial business
that said we are still trying to refine it so that we can find a way for multiple frequency of liberty to be a contributor to both d i y and commercial growth that accelerated rate
i think it all thanks so much thank you
thank you our next question is coming from michael lesser u b s your line is open
good morning thanks for taking my question bill you talked about cost filling up the pressure that you feeling from investments in the focus use you still have on generating earnings growth using based on all of those factors that you're going to resume
a double digit e p s growth any time soon even if you are comps returned to normal
i think a couple of things that are one of which is that you know think about the mile being broken down into two ways one he growth and then share repurchase we still have very strong cash flow generation and are able to generate
if the escrow through share repurchase
on the other side of the equation when you are right we have made some investment and we have some cost headwinds in the immediate term but on a long term basis full anniversary a lot of those i investments and
yet more normalized growth rates and cost and as a resumed two more normalized growth rate in calm store sales our expectation is that our e p s growth rate of certain they increase over where it is today and i whether or not it gets to a double digit number will wait and see what was going to
support both from the commercial side of the business as well as just a good expense management and i think we can achieve both of those things over time
in the meantime are making some wise investments and we testing out the markets in order to continue to gain market share in both sides of the business retail and commercial remains an incredibly healthy industry with an incredibly helped him
and our expectations that will continue to improve our earnings growth rate
in my follow up question is there is now a lack
of auto parts stores
in the u.s. between you and your competitors uh well into the double digit thousands your opening another hundred and fifty this year at what point is a market saturated with too many auto parts stores and the need to consider
reducing substantially reduce in your square footage inclusive
yes thank you for that
we feel we're opening new stores in markets that don't have the same competitive landscape as some of our more core markets
but if you look at many of the core markets less like atlanta for example it seems that the big four auto zone o'reilly's advance and half of all have a tremendous amount of stores in that market place and we all seem to do just fine i returned characteristics
we're not going to open a store unless it does
a fifteen percent higher r or at twelve percent are already uncertain strategic markets we continue to be able to find those films so that you know the cash flow characters
this business or tremendous and were still able to open stores that far exceed those purnell rates
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm matthew fassler where the line is open
thanks good morning guys are a good good my first question relates to eschew name
so so you didn't have it bigger a higher year on year growth rate and you'd had over the first nine months of the year by about two hundred fifty basis points at the same time you're growth rate a russian a growth rate in the fourth quarter
um was ultimately sub so on a two year basis there was not as much as a that was as much of the delta as we think about
the rate of best unit growth and i guess looking the two year stacks and the and the astronaut growth is quite modest quit when i was the first nine months of this year the first three quarters of this year is the dollar growth rate that we saw queue
for look like yet sufficient
do what you need to give the business given how low the s growth was particularly in the middle of the year in your shelves were quite sauce
yeah i would say that the q four is probably a reasonably good target number for us as a kind of think about going forward and so you know she's just to jump to the chase occupant
it was a little bit higher this quarter
some friends pressures there on some of the new markets that we have gotten into and some of the investments that we made them technology which typically have a shorter depreciation life if driven depreciation
but i think the q four is probably
metrics to look at
and um my my second question bill jars also most likely for you so it looks like give her he disclosed on the buyback what we saw in the share count their one hundred two things one on ones that you must have bought back most of your stock
uh quite early
um in in the quarter to get that six twenty two mark and secondly even the buyback was a bit smaller than we are models share count was lower presumably to spend on stock press wasn't treasure and that is so can you just give us clarity on both of those items are listed by that
yeah and one of the things to think about two by the relative by back overall for the year is that i mean i think we came and around a billion seventy or so for total share repurchases this year but keep in mind also were kind of measuring or what kind of
metric in back to that two point five times credit metrics are and we wind up to fifty seven or so so we're a little bit ahead
what are our typical target is which was also to maintain investment grade raiding the trip
is the right place for us to be so there is no change in the capital allocation strategy
you may walk back to stock a little bit earlier in the quarter overall but more importantly from the capital allocation strategy we are maintaining that two point five times the dark red metric maintaining an investment grade rating and will continue to deploy capital and that
... did did the treasure map become a not share count down a little bit you know sort of options valuation suckers that part of the calculus for the share count being being a sub judice at once
yeah maybe just a little bit relative to the share to the option accounting this is definitely has a little bit of an impact on that
thank you so much thanks
thank you our next question is coming from al your skin f e t i g your line is now open
thank you very much the first question to build roads built you spoke about the expense headwinds and in particular higher wages and you think that that s in a more just twenty seventeen phenomenon or do you believe that that may continue going forward
and if so what you contemplate may be raising prices or is inflation there solely predicated on commodity prices and other factors
it's very question now first of all i think there's two different elements of it that have happened first of all there were a series of retailers that move wages in two thousand and fifty
you know sixteen and the effects of those wage increases by large retailers
and had a trickle down effect to the rest of the market that you would think would presumably be getting over in the next year or eighteen months as the market adjust to those rates the second element of it as the regulatory and this is the smaller piece today
it's going to get bigger and bigger over the next three or four years there you know municipalities like los angeles county that went to twelve dollars minimal
wage on july first the state of california is going to go to twelve dollar from animal waits on january first and all these are going to be marching towards fifteen dollars an hour average weight that will cause pressure
wages for an extended period of time will that reflect and increased retail prices will at the end of the day inflation gets into businesses and this industry has shown over time that as inflation comes in and we are able
to pass along many of those calls is not all of them to the consumer can increase
so that's the way we're thinking about it today that it really it really is unprecedented in my career to us
is the latest go up the extent that they have this year so my senses they will continue to be up for a year or so and then it will be muted from where it is today but still it's elevated levels
thank you and then just a follow up if i may so obviously the skull seventeen was a was a tough year it that persists
being longer than what you anticipate which you contemplate even slowing down to investment profile or do you think that it's prudent in this environment to continue with but with building the mega hubs and the amnesty program
yeah i think i think fun related to our performance our investment profile will slow down just a little bit because we opened a new distribution center in mexico and new and pascoe washington
in the process of building one in ocala florida and expanding on danville illinois
that kind of one hand efforts
much of that cats sex is rolling in over a two to three year fiscal side
and that will go back to normal based upon i love the fact that two thousand and seventeen was a really tough year we grew in earnings per share by six percent now we would not change our investment profile based upon these kind of result
um weekly baleen in the long term of this business as i tried to articulate earlier this is not an unusual cycle for our industry to go through we saw it back in two thousand and thirteen we saw it in two thousand
four and five we saw it and ninety eight ninety nine so these things happen over the long term this businesses really really strong and we expect that to continue to be so
thank you built like you i don't appreciate it thank you our next question is coming from seeing the encouragement from morgan stanley your line is open
thanks good morning my first question is clarification follow up to some of the questions that have been asked
um maybe for bill giles
if it for twenty eighteen the condoms return back to let is a two and a half to three percent
i'm just trying to ascertain the expense run rate and maybe margin for next year will begin with growth look more normal on that basis or there is still some elevated spending
in the year
and as part of that question
if comes or two and a half or so three d that entice you to speed up some investments
such that you don t see the full flow through anyway
you can put his feet up investments obviously we're going to make investments on the places for which we believe that we are getting adequate returns on the still articulated earlier and i met day as an example we haven't seen the full results of that so we pulled back on that a little bit
i saw that show up on some of the margin so i think that you know it's the same store sales were to get to two and a half or three percent said obviously would improve our
the department's there is no question about ...
and we'll manage expenses accordingly will make sure that we continue to provide great customer service along the way and will make the investments are we believe that we are getting good adequate returns on them and to make adjustments along the way if we find opportunities where we're getting real benefits
and it makes economic sense for us to accelerate investments will do that at the same time we have demonstrated that where it doesn't make sense will pull back on those investments so it we're getting hypothetical about the next year but you know look a model still intact
and uh it remains of rel relatively healthy industry and we feel
what about our position has been they change
okay and then my follow up for build roads regarding the the industry's top line i don t know if if what is sort of normal for this industry is two to three two or three or four so
but i'm curious if you the way you look at the last year is if we're sort of good not to glide path down to some new normal that may be less than that three to four or if the if the slowdown is cyclical and we should get back to the old normal run rate
yeah it is i mentioned in our prepared remarks that our last five year average same store sales has been one point nine percent so you know from from and obviously same store sales is different than industry growth rate because you've got new stores that are driving industry
rolls royce that seems to be what we've experienced as normal over the last five years with them that number we also had accelerated growth from coma
yeah we were going during that period of time commercial and that's in the low twenties we don t we don t believe we are going to be running low teens in the forseeable future and so i think we'll be challenged even to get back to that
but i think i think we'll get close to this okay thank you
thank you our next question is coming from brad jordan jefferies your line is now open
the morning guys
every morning question on the corner i mean i've heard a lot of negative feedback and the channel about temperature related products sales air conditioning could you give us some color as to
maybe what that a c and recharge product line would mean in your fourth quarter and maybe how negative about category comp was year over year
and i'm going to get into specifics numbers but if you put all the ac related so radiators to hold cooling system and with air conditioning system combine both a chemicals it's a pretty significant part of our busy
particularly in the summer time in the in the double digits
years and it had a very tough period during the summer we fully that you know those things happen over time the article or some are particularly in june was really cool and that will normalize over time and it will come back
but we've dealt with more whether impacts really this year and i hate to talk about them but we can see them categorically in our business so we've seen the lack of winter weather coming through the maintenance cycle on breaks and chassis and the like and then
with a cold winter we saw it in those three businesses banks and on the online question
yes you are talking about sequential improvement and the online traffic at least with a driving a fair amount of pick up and store volume could you give us a feeling for how much
take up into store volume you're actually seeing there is obviously not getting booked into the other category and then within the auto anything it is that performance improving as well or is it lagging autumn zone dot com
yeah i would say on the up and store of business you know that that remains
it's a very small portion of our overall businesses you would imagine but it is by far the fastest growing channel of distribution that we have and it has accelerated and so we think we are doing a great job on that side of it on auto anything he said
a bit more of a challenging year nice manager
changes there and we are seeing trends improve their so we see business getting a little bit better at auto anything
okay and you're not discounting the online transaction with a pick up in store right that is happening at the store prize not the shift to whom does count as threats okay thank you thank you
before we can close the call i would like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be so we are excited about our growth prospects for the year we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives
we have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year but i want to stress that this is a marathon not a sprint as we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long term shareholder value we are confident auto zone will continue to be very successful

finan our chief operating officer sean windy at and im pleased to introduce steve mcmurray our chief financial officer who has recently joined us steve brings to b g c a broad skill set having previously worked as
the director of finance at amlin a uk based insurance company and as the chief financial accountant at the bank of england welcome steve we are pleased to have you with us
b g c's post tax earnings increased by twenty four percent to seventy seven million dollars while our revenues were up by seventeen percent to six hundred and sixty million dollars our strong performance was
driven by the addition of gfi the ongoing success of n g k f and the sixty eight percent year over year revenue increase generated by our high margin fully electronic fenix business we expect
our results to further improve as we continue to invest the proceeds from our sale of tray port and continue to realize synergies from gfi and our other recent acquisitions given our liquidity
position and expectations for strong pre tax earnings growth our board raised our dividend to sixteen cents for the first quarter which represents an increase of fourteen point three percent both sequentially
and year on year at yesterdays closing stock price this translates into a six point eight percent annualized yield with that i'll turn the call over to sean
thanks howard and good morning everyone our financial services revenues were up by twenty two point eight percent to four hundred and thirty six point seven million dollars these revenues would have been
around seven million dollars higher had the us dollar not strengthened relative to the other major currencies the increase in revenues was driven by the acquisition of gfi as well as the
organic growth from our data software and post trade businesses and from energy and commodities as well as equities and other asset classes our financial services business increased its pre tax earnings
by thirty one point four percent to one hundred and two point nine million dollars pre tax margin was twenty three point six percent a one hundred and sixty basis points increase
improvement in financial services profitability reflected the synergies we were able to extract with respect to gfi as well as strong growth from our fully electronic fenix platform fenix revenues rose by
sixty eight point one percent to sixty eight point six million dollars while its pre tax earnings increased by fifty five point two percent to thirty one point eight million dollars this strong performance
was driven by the addition of gfi as well as by the strong double digit organic growth generated by our data software post trade and fully electronic credit business you may have
noticed we changed the term market data and software solutions to data software and post trade to better reflect a growing electronic post trade business at post trade services by generating strong
momentum and our success in this platform demonstrates b g c's technological focus and capabilities we expect substantial growth for this sector going forward looking at our overall financial services results by asset class we more
than doubled revenues from our fully electronic credit desks while our overall credit revenues grew by twenty five point eight percent to eighty four point five million dollars our fx businesses increased by
seven percent to seventy eight million dollars our energy and commodities revenues were up by one hundred and twenty nine point six percent to sixty seven point five million dollars and revenues from equities
and other asset classes increased by forty one point four percent to fifty one point two million and revenues from our rates products were down by two point nine percent to one
hundred and eighteen point five million largely due to a decline in european wholesale market activity industry wide offsetting this industry wide decline we expect growth from our fenix rates platform to
drive our rates revenues higher in the second half of this year while the overall trading environment was challenging for our largest customers during the first quarter we believe we have continued
to gain market share from our financial services competitors turning now to our results for the real estate services n g k f's revenues increased by seven point two percent to two hundred and fourteen
point eight million dollars due to a fifteen point four percent increase in revenues from higher margin real estate capital markets brokerage and thirteen point four percent growth from largely recurring management services
fees we believe that n g k f's revenue out growth outpaced the relevant industry metrics our comparative outperformance was driven in part by organic growth as well as by the additions of computerized facility integration
excess space and the completion of our acquisition of a r a weve also continued to invest in high profile and talented brokers having added over one hundred brokers since the second quarter of
two thousand fifteen historically newly hired commercial real estate brokers tend to achieve dramatically higher productivity in their second year with the company although we incur related expenses immediately this is largely why n g k f's
revenues were higher but its pre tax distributable earnings were down by eleven point one percent to seventeen point four million dollars as our newly hired brokers ramp up their production we expect
n g k f's revenue and earnings growth to strongly accelerate in the second half of two thousand and sixteen thus demonstrating our operating leverage although u s industry wide activity across commercial leasing and capital
markets was down in the first quarter we expect n g k f's top line growth to outperform that of the overall industry by approximately twenty percentage point twenty percentage points for the full year of two thousand and sixteen with
that i'm now happy to turn the call over to steve
thank you sean good morning everyone its great to be here and i look forward to getting to know you all over the coming quarters this was the fourth full quarter in
which our results include those of gfi q one two thousand and fifteen only included gfi for one month b g c generated consolidated revenues of six hundred and sixty point one million dollars up seventeen
point one percent compared to the prior year our revenues from the americas were up by sixteen percent revenues from europe middle east and africa were up by eighteen percent while asia
pacific revenues increased by seventeen percent with respect to expenses our compensation ratio decreased by around thirty basis points to sixty one point four percent while non compensation expenses increased in
absolute terms by sixteen point four percent they were down approximately twenty basis points as a percentage of revenues at twenty four point eight percent point our overall margin improved due to
synergies realized to gfi and a greater percentage of financial services revenues from the higher margin fenix platform with respect to our one hundred million dollars in expected annualized cost synergies we
are happy to report that we are more than eighty percent of the way there with regard to earnings our pre tax earnings before non controlling interest in subsidiaries and
taxes were ninety point eight million dollars up twenty point seven percent when compared with the prior year our pre tax margin expanded by nearly fifty basis points to thirteen point eight percent
b g c's post tax earnings were up by twenty four percent to seventy seven million dollars our post tax earnings margin was eleven point seven percent an expansion of approximately seventy basis points
our post tax earnings per share were unchanged at eighteen cents b g c had a fully diluted weighted average share count of four hundred and thirty four point nine million for distributable earnings
and gaap a year earlier our weighted average fully diluted share count was three hundred and seventy eight point seven million for distributable earnings and three hundred and thirty eight point five
million under gaap our gaap share count from the prior period was lower because it excluded certain share equivalents in order to avoid anti dilution the share count increased primarily due to
issuances related to gfi various other acquisitions equity based employee compensation and new front office hires this was partially offset by the redemption and or repurchase of seven point six million shares and
units at a cost to b g c of sixty five point nine million dollars or an average of an average cost of eight point seventy per share during the quarter as of march the thirty first two thousand sixteen
our fully diluted share count was four hundred and thirty point eight million including the twenty three point five million shares issued subsequent to year end in connection with
the gfi back end merger and assuming conversion of b g c's four point five percent convertible senior notes into sixteen point three million shares moving onto the balance sheet as of quarter end
the companys liquidity which we define as cash and cash equivalents marketable securities securities owned held for liquidity purposes less securities loaned was six hundred and eighty point six million dollars
notes payable and collateralized borrowings were eight hundred and thirty eight point six million dollars book value per common share was three dollars and fifteen cents and total capital which we defines as redeemable partnership interest
non controlling interest in subsidiaries and total stockholders equity was one billion two hundred and twenty four point nine million dollars in comparison as of december thirty first two thousand fifteen the companys
liquidity was one billion twenty six point one million dollars notes payable and collateralized borrowings and notes payable to related parties were eight hundred and forty point nine million dollars book value per
common share was two dollars and fifty six cents and total capital was one billion two hundred and ninety nine point seven million dollars the decrease in b g c's liquidity since year end was pri primarily related
to the one hundred and eleven point two million dollars paid with respect to the gfi back end merger and related transactions half use of the redemption and or repurchase of seven point
six million shares and or units net at a cost to b g c of sixty five point nine million dollars cash used to pay previously accrued year end taxes and employee bonuses and significant amounts
invested with regards to new front office hires in real estate services its important to note that our balance sheet does not reflect the expected receipt of over seven hundred and sixty
five million dollars worth of additional nasdaq stock over the next twelve years as these shares are contingent upon nasdaq generating at least twenty five million dollars in gross revenues annually if
nasdaq undergoes a change of control we would get these shares all at once to put the twenty five million dollars contingency in context nasdaq has recorded more than one point five
billion dollars in gross revenues for each of the last ten years and generated gross revenues of approximately three point four billion dollars in two thousand fifteen with that im happy to turn the
call back over to howard
thank you steve our outlook for the second quarter of twenty sixteen compared with a year earlier is as follows we expect to generate distributable earnings revenues of between six
hundred and forty five million dollars and six hundred and eighty five million dollars compares with six hundred and eighty four point six million dollars we anticipate generating pre tax earnings of between
eight five and a hundred million dollars thats an increase of between ten and twenty nine percent and that compares to seventy seven point five million dollars and we continue to
expect our effective tax rate to remain around fifteen percent for the remainder of twenty sixteen the companys outlook reflects the sale of tray port in december of twenty fifteen tray port generated annualized gross revenues
of approximately eighty million dollars and pre tax profits of over thirty five million dollars we are proud that we have more than made up for these earnings through our ongoing successful integration
of gfi and through the growth of fenix we also expect n g k f's performance to be much stronger in the second half of twenty sixteen both sequentially and year on year
due to to the significant and recent ramp up of our real estate broker headcount we anticipate updating our outlook towards the end of june so now operator we are ready to open
the call for questions
nothing would be put back to b g c p
absolutely nothing they they paid us closed signed sealed delivered over it has nothing to do with us whatsoever
how much of the synergies and whats still i thought i heard eighty percent but could you just refresh the numbers on the gfi synergies and where we are
you remember last where we said we were up to a hundred million that we would do a hundred million by the end of
two thousand sixteen and in the prepared notes we suggested we were eighty percent of the way there uh during the first quarter so uh uh more than eighty million at the end of q one
i thought being the one point two billion in revenue targeted for two thousand sixteen
its either both revised or not revised meaning uh we had said last time if the industry was up to zero we would be up
twenty percent more and that would put us at a billion two if the industry is down five percent you know we would be five percent lower and if the industry was up
five percent we would be five percent higher so i think we just put a more uh nuanced uh point to it which is if the industry is flat for the year we expect
last quarter where we saw that basically flat to possibly up five percent i think right now what we see is down five percent so i think thats sort of the math
given normal seasonality trends can you dig into that a little bit deeper please
strong strong markets obviously the traditional marketplace with regards to sell side banks have continued to go through difficult times but we continue to grow into that with new
all right got you and one last one for me um liquidity declined i think it was three hundred and forty five million quarter over quarter i think you spoke broadly about
closed the balance of the gfi acquisition which was about a hundred and eleven
million dollars uh we bought back stock for just about sixty six million dollars uh we had said that we had taxes on the tray port transaction obviously we paid them during the quarter uh we had said
our next question comes from robert crain from mid ocean partners
we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call over to mister lutnick for closing remarks
thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect
hello and welcome this is b p s first quarter two thousand and sixteen results webcast and conference call i am jess mitchell b p s head of investor relations and i am here with our chief financial officer brian gill very before we start i need to draw your attention to our cautionary statement
during todays presentation we will make forward looking statements that refer to our estimates plans and expectations actual results and outcomes could differ materially due to factors we note on this slide and in our u k and s e c filings please refer to our annual report stock exchange announcement and s e c filings for more details
these documents are available on our website thank you and now over to brian thanks jess welcome everybody and thank you for joining us it has been a challenging start to the year for our industry it is also a quarter in which we have seen considerable progress in our own business as we work to reposition the group
we continue to see real momentum in resetting the cost base this is working to lower the point in which we expect to rebalance organic cash flows in two thousand and seventeen and support our continued commitment to sustaining the dividend as you have seen in this mornings release our focus on costs together with sound operations has also supported the solid
underlying earnings and cash flow delivery you have seen today despite the much weaker market conditions so i will start today by looking at the business environment before covering our first quarter numbers in detail i will then update you on our medium term financial frame where we continue to demonstrate both flexibility and resilience in our approach to resetting the company i will finish
with a brief look at the first quarter progress in our businesses before jess and i take your questions starting with an update on the macroeconomics where the markets is responding to low oil prices and progressing broadly along the path we laid out to you early in the year global oil demand looks set to increase strongly again
this year supported by low oil prices we expect demand growth to be around one point four billion barrels per day this year a little weaker than last year but still comfortably above the historical average at the same time global supply growth is likely to be flat to falling with u s tight oil supply falling in particular only partially
offset by increases in iranian production so our view has not changed materially over the past six to nine months we continue to expect the combination of robust demand and weak supply growth to move to market closer into balance by the end of this year this will still leave record high oil inventories to be worked down before a more settled
position emerges looking more specifically at the price environment so far this year we continue to oversupply brent crude oil fell to an average of thirty four dollars per barrel in the first quarter compared to forty four dollars per barrel in the fourth quarter and fifty four dollars per barrel
a year ago henry hub gas prices continue to decline in the first quarter with spot prices averaging just below two dollars per million british thermal units the mild winter in the united states continued to suppress demand while supply remained ample including gas and storage at unseasonably high levels
the global refining market margin averaged ten dollars fifty per barrel in the first quarter the lowest since the third quarter of two thousand and ten weighed down by weak diesel demand and high gasoline stocks in the united states refined margins have recovered averaging twelve dollars seventy so far
in the second quarter this weaker environment is consistent with the assumptions we built into our plans for the first part of the year while it has had a significant impact on our results in the first quarter this was also a period of strong operational delivery and visible progress on our cost and efficiency agenda turning
to the results for the group b ps first quarter underlying replacement cost profit was five hundred and thirty million dollars down seventy nine percent on the same period a year ago and one hundred and seventy percent higher in the fourth quarter of two thousand fifteen compared to a year ago the result reflects lower upstream realizations a weaker refining environment and the absence of a one off
tax benefit arising from changes to u k supplementary taxation this was partly offset by lower cash costs across the group compared to the previous quarter the result reflects lower costs across the group and a higher contribution from supply and trading partly offset by lower upstream realizations and
a weaker refining environment first quarter underlying operating cash flow which excludes gulf of mexico oil spill payments was three billion dollars the first quarter dividend payable in the second quarter of two thousand and sixteen remains unchanged at ten cents per ordinary share
in upstream the underlying first quarter replacement cost loss before interest and tax of seven hundred and fifty million dollars compared to the profit of six hundred million dollars a year ago and a loss of seven hundred and thirty million dollars in the fourth quarter of two thousand and
fifteen compared to the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen the result reflects significantly lower liquids and gas realizations partly offset by lower costs from simplification and efficiency activities lower rig cancelation costs and lower d d and a excluding rosneft first quarter reported production versus a year ago was five point two percent
higher after adjusting for entitlements and divestments impacts underlying production decreased by one point one percent compared to the fourth quarter the result reflects lower realizations largely offset by significantly lower costs including lower exploration write offs looking ahead we expect second quarter two thousand and sixteen reported production to be lower than the
first quarter reflecting p s a entitlements impacts and seasonal turnaround maintenance activity in the downstream the first quarter underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax was one point eight billion dollars compared with two point two billion dollars a year ago and one point two billion dollars in the
fourth quarter of two thousand and fifteen the fuels business reported an underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax of one point three billion dollars in the first quarter compared with one point eight billion dollars in the same quarter last year and eight hundred and ninety million dollars in the fourth quarter of two thousand
and fifteen compared to a year ago the rest reflects a significantly weaker refining environment and a lower contribution from supply and trading compared with a very strong result in the same period last year partly offset by lower costs from our simplification and efficiency programs strong refinery operations and a higher
retail result supported by volume growth compared to the fourth quarter the result reflects a strong contribution from supply and trading compared with the small loss last quarter lower costs and strong refining operations partly offset by a weaker refining environment and seasonally lower fuels marketing
margin capture the lubricants business delivered an underlying replacement cost profit of three hundred and eighty million dollars in the first quarter compared with three hundred and fifty million dollars in the same quarter last year reflecting strong premium brand performance and margin growth despite adverse foreign exchange
impacts the petrochemicals business reported an underlying replacement cost profit of a hundred and ten million dollars compared to twenty million dollars a year ago reflecting improved operations lower costs and a slightly improved margin environment in the second quarter we expect the significantly higher level of turnaround activity particularly in the united states
and some seasonal improvements in industry refining margins turning to rosneft based on preliminary information we have recognized around seventy million dollars as our estimate of b p s share of rose nets underlying net income for the first quarter compared to around a hundred and eighty million dollars a year ago and two hundred and thirty
thirty five million dollars in the fourth quarter of two thousand and fifteen our estimate of b p s share of rose nets production for the first quarter is just over one million barrels of oil equivalent per day similar to both a year ago and the fourth quarter additional details will be made available by rosneft with their
results on the twenty second of april the rosneft broad indicated an intention to increase its dividend payout to thirty five percent of i f r s earnings at current exchange rates this would imply dividend payable to b p of around three hundred and thirty million dollars after tax for two thousand fifteen payable in the third quarter of two thousand sixteen the
final decision regarding the payout will be taken at rose nets annual general shareholders meeting in june in other business and corporate we reported a pretax underlying replacement cost charge of a hundred and eighty million dollars for the first quarter a hundred and ten million dollars lower than the same period a year ago this reflects lower corporate and functional costs and foreign exchange benefits we continue to expect the average
underlying quarterly charge for the year to be around three hundred million dollars although this may fluctuate between individual quarters the underlying tax rate in the first quarter was eighteen percent and reflects tax credits from the reported upstream loss offsetting tax charges elsewhere in the business together with the deferred tax benefit from the weaker u s dollar this compares to a rate of twenty one
percent in the same period a year ago after adjusting for the u k north sea supplementary charge in two thousand fifteen in the current environment and with our existing portfolio of assets we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be lower than the adjusted two thousand and fifteen rate of thirty one percent which excludes
the previously mentioned north sea tax credit turning to the gulf of mexico oil spill costs and provisions earlier this month the court entered final judgment on the consent decree relating to the two thousand and fifteen agreement to settle all federal and state claims arising from the
deepwater horizon incident as a result the consent decree and settlements agreement are now effective the total cumulative pretax charge for the incidence to date is fifty six point four billion dollars or forty point seven billion dollars after tax
the charge for the first quarter was nine hundred and seventy million dollars which includes five hundred and ninety three million dollars related to business economic loss claims not provided for two hundred and one million dollars of costs relating to the settlement of certain civil claims outside of the two thousand twelve class action settlement and other
administration costs and financing costs of a hundred and twenty three million it is still not possible to reliably estimate the remaining liability for business economic loss claims and we continue to review this each quarter we have however now agreed simplified and accelerated procedures for processing claims which you see reflected in todays higher charge of the twenty billion dollars paid into the
trust fund nineteen point eight billion dollars is now being paid out with the remainder allocated to amounts already provided for the pretax cash outflow on costs related to the oil spill for the first quarter was one point one billion dollars including five hundred and thirty million dollars relating to the two thousand and twelve criminal
settlement with the united states department of justice we also expect a further one point one billion dollars of payments in respect of the two thousand fifteen settlement as well as further payments related to business economic loss claims under the costs not yet provided for we will continue to update you on a quarterly basis including any further developments with the private
securities litigation under m d l two one eight five now looking at cash flow this slide compares our sources and uses of cash in the first quarter of two thousand sixteen excluding oil spill related outgoings underlying cash flow for the quarter was three billion dollars including a working capital build of around eight hundred million dollars gulf of mexico oil spill payments
of one point one billion dollars were offset against the divestment proceeds which also amounted to one point one billion dollars in the first quarter including oil spill payments operating cash flow for the quarter was one point nine billion dollars similar to a year ago organic capital expenditure in the first quarter was three point nine billion dollars
compared to four point four billion dollars a year ago turning now to our financial frame and starting with some context our financial frame work is designed to grow long term value for shareholders while maintaining the financial health and liquidity of the group this requires us to determine the right level of reinvestment to continue to grow value
while ensuring we distribute sustainable returns to shareholders we believe getting this right is strongly length to making the right decisions about our portfolio at its simplest we are prioritize value over volume and will continue to do so on an ongoing basis we look to divest assets which no longer fit with our strategy and deepen in assets which add the most value
at the same time we drive returns through disciplined investment into the best projects in the current environment all this still applies but we have an added imperative to make very careful judgments about how we use our scarce capital we have to balance the pace of investment to capture maximum deflation which ensuring we maintain safe
operations and preserve future growth we also wish to retain flexibility to add to the portfolio at the lowest point of the cycle if the right opportunities present themselves so there is a lot of moving parts that we need to continue to manage while the environment remains unsettled
we entered this down cycle with a strong balance sheet and we have a strong portfolio with the resilient downstream in a new wave of material upstream projects startups in sight we have also moved very quickly to reset the cost base of the company for a lower price environment consistent with many others we anticipate a modestly more favorable oil price environment in two thousand seventeen
than we see today but believe we have the flexibility to extend the range of outcomes if oil prices remain lower for longer than anticipated there will inevitably be tradeoffs that we need to take but we will continue to be governed in these decisions by what we consider to be in the best long term interests of shareholders
looking at the specifics of our financial frame we continue to make strong progress on resetting both the capital and cash cost base of the group we now expect capital expenditure in relation to the current portfolio to be around seventeen billion dollars this year
we see room to reduce this to between fifteen and seventeen billion dollars per annum for two thousand seventeen in the event of a continued low oil price this compares to our guidance in february of seventeen to nineteen billion dollars per annum for the same period while at that time two thousand sixteen s spend was expected
to be at the lower end of that range todays guidance suggest that thirty to forty percent drop in capital expenditure by two thousand seventeen compared to around twenty five billion dollars of spend at the peak in two thousand thirteen when brent oil prices averaged a hundred and nine dollars per barrel
the reduction has come through paring back exploration spend prioritization of marginal activity and the capture of accelerating deflation the supply chain as we time our investment decisions significantly it also reflects a strong drive towards capital efficiency in our development plans which is allowing us to deliver the same activity for less spend in areas where we still see flexibility to optimize
activity we will judge very carefully the implications of the business retaining the ability to increase activity if prices strengthen we will continue to realize deepening deflation and balance the overall best use of funds to the prevailing oil price our intention remains to stay very focused on both
safety and our growth plans for the future we also continue to move quickly to lower controllable cash costs across the group the groups cash costs over the last four quarters were four point six billion dollars lower than two thousand and fourteen this demonstrates the ongoing momentum behind our efforts to reduce costs and put us about two thirds of the way through to delivering
the seven billion dollars of cash cost reductions by two thousand and seventeen compared to two thousand and fourteen as we continue to look in capital efficiencies and embed structural simplification along with the more controlled organization we expect the large part of the cost savings to be sustainable for the future
non operating restructuring charges are expected to approach two point five billion dollars in total by the end of two thousand sixteen with around one point nine billion dollars incurred so far since the fourth quarter of two thousand fourteen of this around three hundred and fifty million dollars was incurred in the first quarter
our principal aim is to reestablish a balance where operating cash flow covers capital expenditure and the dividend over time in this way we look to ensure that levels of re investments and distributions are consistent with the long term growth of our underlying business we have been working towards a goal of rebalancing by two thousand seventeen at the prevailing oil
price which back in october two thousand fifteen we paid at sixty per barrel consistent with the forward curve at that time as we steadily take more costs down the brent oil price of which we would expect to break even continues to move lower we now anticipate rebalancing organic sources and uses of cash by twenty seventeen at oil
prices in the range fifty to fifty five dollars per barrel this currently refines the basis for our ongoing commitment to sustaining the dividend as the first priority with our financial framework actual inflows and outflows will be subject to ongoing recalibration to the environment including the judgements we make around levels of capital expenditure
and any changes to the portfolio once rebalancing is achieved organic free cash flow is expected to start to grow at constant prices supported by the stronger cash flows expected from our upstream project start ups over the medium term this will in turn support distributions to shareholders
with divestments having reached ten billion dollars over two thousand fourteen and fifteen we continue to expect three to five billion dollars of divestments in two thousand sixteen and around two to three billion dollars per annum thereafter in line with our historical norms the proceeds from these divestments provide additional flexibility to manage oil price volatility and
capacity to meet our deep water horizon payment commitments in the united states turning to gearing at the end of the first quarter net debt was thirty billion dollars with gearing at twenty three point six percent this includes the impact of the consent decree and settlements agreement with the gulf states had and on our balance sheet during two thousand fifteen
and the scheduling of payments over an extended period as a reminder during two thousand ten we lowered our gearing band from historical range of twenty to thirty percent down to ten to twenty percent to manage uncertainties mainly in relation to the deep water horizon incident having finalized these agreements we are re-establishing
a twenty to thirty percent gearing band going forward now turning briefly to the highlights of the quarter from our businesses starting with the upstream we have seen continued strong operational performance plan reliability was ninety five percent across our operator producing assets and we saw strong drilling performance particularly in the united states lower forty eight and
azerbaijan delivering both cost and efficiency benefits the first quarter saw the start up of the in salah southern fields major project in algeria and we also recently saw the start up of the point thomson project in alaska we also have two projects in the commissioning stage and two further projects continue to progress well for start up later in the year with facilities work nearing completion for example we saw the safe arrival of the new
f p s o for quad two oh four in norway ahead of its installation to the west of shetland this summer ready for start up around the end of the year overall we continue to have momentum on our upstream major projects portfolio as we look beyond this year our two thousand seventeen start ups are on track and together with our six two thousand sixteen start ups we expect to put in place five hundred thousand oil
million barrels per day of new net bp capacity by the end of two thousand seventeen versus two thousand fifteen for example our cause on project facilities are now sixty nine percent complete with forty six well pads completed and start up expected to be a little ahead of schedule
juniper which will back for production in to our trinidad lng trends is progressing well with over fifty five percent facilities completion in egypt facilities for the taurus libra phase of our west nile delta project are also on schedule and around fifty percent complete while the top side modules for clair region in north sea our own rig from south
korea and are expected to arrive later this quarter beyond these two thousand seventeen start ups the production facilities for our shah deniz phase two project are ahead of plan at around seventy percent completion with first gas scheduled for two thousand and eighteen
all of this means we made on track for the delivery of over eight hundred thousand barrels per day of production from new major projects by twenty twenty in february our first exploration discovery of the year was announced on nooros east prospect in egypt by the operator annie who have now tied it back for production meanwhile we have completed evaluation of the bp operated kepler three discovery
drilled in late two thousand and fifteen and are in the process of tying this well into our na kika platform with the aim of starting production later this year these are great examples of the opportunity for record monetization of near field discoveries of what we call infrastructure led exploration the first quarter was a strong quarter for new access including farm ins and licenses awarded for
acreage in norway and new farm in canada with an aggregate total of around twelve thousand square kilometres in oman we singed a major agreement to extend the cause on license to access a further one thousand square kilometres estimated to contain around three point five trillion cubic feet of gas combined plateau production from phases one and two is expected to total approximately one point five b
c f of gas a day equivalent to around forty percent of oman s current total domestic gas production additionally in the first quarter the governments of india announced the series of policy initiatives including marketing and pricing freedom for natural gas produced from deep water discoveries which we believe is a positive development
evaluating for future projects we also signed two new agreements one with kuwait petroleum corporation to enhance recovery of existing oil and gas resources and pursue future oil and exploration opportunities and a production sharing agreements in china to develop shale gas resources
in the downstream the first quarter saw strong year on year underlying performance improvement mitigating the impact of a weaker refining environment at the same time our refineries are four percent increase in utilization while we increase the amount of advantage to heavy crude processed by more than twenty percent and in petrochemicals we are improving the
cash break even of the business making it more robust to a bottom of cycle environment our marketing growth strategy continues to deliver results the global roll out of our ultimate fuels with active technology represents our biggest fuel launch in over a decade we also expanded our convenience retail partnerships in germany and the netherlands and we became the worlds first
supplier for commercial jet fire fuel using existing airport infrastructure in lubricants we continue to see double digit earnings growth supported by strong premium brand performance and growth market positions and simplification and efficiency has progressed across the downstream into two thousand sixteen keeping the business on track to deliver two point five billion dollars of cost efficiencies by the end of two thousand seventeen
taking together this momentum in underlying performance improvement continues to support the increase resilience of the downstream business in summary the environment is very challenging but we are seeing the benefit of how we move quickly to respond we have considerable momentum around resetting
cost base this is driven by both the pace of which we are capturing deflation and our own simplification efforts you have seen more evidence of this across all our businesses in todays results we are steadily lowering the oil price that which we expect to balance organic sources and uses of cash by twenty seventeen while retaining sufficient flexibility to make the right
choices about our portfolio to sustain growth i believe we are making strong progress we are executing our project safely and more efficiently driving down costs and making careful judgements about the best use of scarce capital and all our decisions continue to be guided by our ultimate aim to grow sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the
long term on that note thank you for listening and i will now open up for questions if audio participants would like to ask a question you may do so by pressing star one to cancel your question please press the hash or pound key if you are listening on the web please submit your question by using the web question facility
thank you for all those waiting on the line we will take the first question today from irene he mona at sub ten are you there irene thank you jess good afternoon i had three questions relating to capex if i may brian
the new budget for next year is fifteen to seventeen billion what proportion of the reduction versus this years budget would you say is inflation secondly within the fifteen seventeen roughly how much would you say is maintenance versus let us say growth
and then finally in your comments regarding the financial framework you referred to the effort to set the right level of reinvestment i wonder if you can clarify how the fifteen seventeen fits in that in other words how do you ensure that is the right level of investment perhaps in terms of i don t know reserve
replacement or other thank you thanks irene maybe if i just sort of start with what we came into this year as we thought about work capital would fall out in terms of the various projects that we pursue we set your range to seventeen to nineteen billion dollars and that was in the middle of this
effectively rebalancing the company out to twenty seventeen it now transpires as we have seen more deflation come through more things we are doing around the ways in which we are working in terms of our own self help we are not confident that actually the capital is coming out of somewhere around seventeen billion dollars so we have sort of revise that guidance
for this year the range for next year is really been set to say actually if the oil price stay which stay low levels that we see today that would have flexibility within the financial frame to move that capital lower that isn t something we would choose to do today in terms of rebalancing of fifty to fifty five dollars a barrel so i think the basic assumption is that to the degree that we see oil
prices staying low there will be similar deflation come through but you should assume next year if all things being equal and we see the second half of this year the firming up of the oil price somewhere we see today and a small recovery quite a modest recovery so we are not talking the major movement from where we are that in the range of fifty to fifty five dollars a barrel you would expect that oil capital will come out somewhere between fifteen to seventeen billion but it probably would not be at the lower
that range would only move to the lower end of the range if we saw continue pressure on the oil prices and that is on todays portfolio in terms of the maintenance versus growth spend i think we have laid out for you all the various projects that we look at the drive growth in terms of sixteen significant growth in seventeen with the projects that come on in the second half of next year typically historically our maintenance capex will come back and confirm it but just from memory from
previous calls typically it is around about forty percent of the capital budget would be around maintenance versus growth thank you and in terms of the let us say right level of reinvestment longer term how do you think about setting that reinvestment
if you look historically both the sector and bp typically we have reinvested anywhere to seventy to eighty percent of capital back into the business in terms of driving future growth so far we have not limited the growth that we laid for you five quarters ago in terms of seventeen eighteen nineteen so we feel that it is the right level of reinvestment as we go through this transition of the oil price
but something around seventy to eighty percent is typical in terms of the sector thank you very much thanks irene we will take a question now from the us blake fernandez of howard weil thanks jess couple of questions on production if you don t mind if i recall the previous guidance was for relatively flattish type of production in sixteen it looks like one q is off to a pretty good start
so i am just curious for one do you think that flat profile was still the right way to look at it and then secondly with five hundred thousand barrels a day of new production coming on through seventeen can you give us an update on what the portfolio decline looks like currently yes so i think first i will start by saying that of course the p s c impacts quarter on quarter
one q this year versus one q last year there is an uptick in terms of where how the p s c works around the actual price itself but we are actually see the strong performance out both the north sea lower forty eight and the gulf of mexico in terms of first quarter production offset a little bit by some issues around some declines in some more lower margin fields in places like trinidad and north africa so in
round it looks strong one q versus one q but a big chunk of that is coming through the p s c effects in terms of looking out into two thousand sixteen i think as lamar laid out on the last call that we had and bob talked about are relative decline the base has been relatively low because we have had a lot of capital focused on the higher return in field development work so actually this year it is running more
closer historically we have said two percent to three percent it is more of the two percent range in terms of this year prefect thank you brian i will level it there thanks we will take the next question from jason gamma l of jefferies yes thank you jess brian i just wanted to come back to the capital cycle and looking into twenty seventeen guiding for the breakeven of fifty to fifty five at the
the upper end of the capex range of seventeen and with the dividend about six and a half that is implying cash from ops of roughly twenty three billion does that include the proceeds from divestitures or is that we expect from operations organically no thanks jason actually what we have done is we have actually changed back in october of last year we relayed out the financial frame i think because now we had certainty around
the vast majority of macondo liabilities what we have done is effectively said operating cash needs to cover capex and dividends and disposal proceeds would be used in terms of macondo liability so if that is not relay on the disposal proceeds in terms of that rebalancing so it is basic simple operating cash needs to cover dividend and capex and to be
clear within the frame that we have laid out it is total dividend it is not just the cash dividend understood and if could just follow up brian on the divestiture process obviously not a massive target but still on an oil price environment where we are at how are you expecting to be able to deliver these divestitures are you going to be more reliant upon midstream
downstream type of assets or would you actually see a market for upstream assets that could achieve value that you would find acceptable yeah everything comes back to the basic principles of what we laid out for you back in two thousand and eleven in terms of value of volume and to a degree that there are assets within our portfolio that we believe a better in the hands of others in terms of reinvestment versus those ones that we would like to maybe acquire so this is not just about disposals that we believe we can add value
we to them and we will look at both sides of that equation in terms of the quantum of three to five for this year and two to three going forward the two to three is the historical average but of course as bob has said on previous quarters we said include or exclude t n k b p we have sold up to seventy five billion dollars if you include t n k b p or fifty billion dollars if you exclude it over the last three of four years so it s there for not surprising and there were a hundred dollars a barrel which was
sold its given where we on the cycle it is not surprising that actually we are really into what is the non strategic tail of the business and two to three feels right going forward the current sweets of assets that we are looking at that you will see it from the various sales announcements that happened they are more midstream but certainly more predominately downstream last year and the first quarter this year but midstream downstream and we will still to look to exit upstream assets
where we believe that the better in hands of others and equally potentially invest in upstream assets and downstream going forward thanks very much brian moving now to lydia rain fourth of barclays are you there lydia thanks jess yeah three questions if i could please the first one on the cost savings and the four point six billion
number versus two thousand and fourteen which is incredibly impressive number can you are you able to spit for us kind of how much of that is upstream how much of that is downstream how much is corporate and just kind of where there are areas where you are actually ahead of what your expectation would be and if there is anywhere where it is actually still lagging behind that needs a bit more work
and then the second question was just coming back to the fifty fifty five dollar per barrel break even in two thousand and seventeen at that stage it looks like the financial framework is rebalanced but then if i look at the project so you do have the cause on check to see it actually is it right to think of that oil price break even moving down beyond twenty seventeen thanks
that is a great question actually so the first question on cash costs it is across the piece it is upstream it is downstream and it is corporate so its i will start with corporate because that is the one that we lay down for you in two thousand and thirteen and you will see from the annual reporting accounts it is actually one of the things that we targeted in terms of the group performance scorecard we have
seen a significant reduction so over thirty percent of costs coming out of those corporate activities equally we are seeing significant reductions in absolute costs in both the upstream and downstream and in terms of what it is doing in the downstream it is efficiency drive in terms of the margin of the boundary is generating so it is both absolute cost reductions but also getting more
efficiency about the way in which those operations run and in the upstream it is really about more efficient ways of working activity optimization organization size and staffing cost but it is also around agency staff and how are those the important part of the organization and in the case of the upstream it is something like i think the peak was thirty thousand and the intent is to get down to something around twenty thousand by twenty
seventeen in terms of total staff b p and agency staff so it is across the piece on the break even economics there is lots of moving parts hence where there is a range around that of course it also depends on the henry hub gas price it depends on the refining margin it depends on what is happening in any different many parts of our business so i would try to deter people from focusing
on a specific point in time oil prices the balancing point because we have a lot of flexibility within the frame itself in terms of how we will get things back into balance but all other things being equal i think to the degree that the oil price where to be lower next year and with the new projects coming on and ramping up into eighteen and we have tried to layout for you just what it look like in terms of balance in terms of surplus cash that obviously alleviates any other pressures that we have around refining margins
other components of the financial frame thank you very much thanks lydia turning now to jon rigby of u b s thank you can i ask three questions actually the first is on the capex number and the sort of visibility you are getting of
cost deflation presumably you are staring to talk to the market around new sanction so maybe you are able to just talk a little bit about what the kind of feedback you are getting on some of those larger sanctions that you may be coming to and that give you the comfort around that cost deflation and the second is just on the
dividend and the oil price progression so you talked about looking to get cash into cash neutrality with a full cash dividend does that mean that you would expect to move to full cash dividend or you are expecting some sort of hybrid of some sort of anti dilution buyback and continue scrip and then the last question and this is of your background brian as well
is that is a big beat in the downstream but there is clearly some significant moving parts on trading both four q to one q one q to one q and i am very clear that the market is tended to give very little in terms of multiple to trading businesses anyway but with that
lack of visibility i am somewhat concern that you would not get very much credit for what looks like a very good number today so is it possible that you can get some more guidance around the moving parts four q to one q one q to one q on that downstream figure thanks okay so i will sort of work backwards so in terms of the downstream result it was not just
about supply and trading that is the first of the point i think that is going to pull one and we actually look at half of that be probably just in the half that came from the supply and trading business which had a stronger quarter than four q where we had a slight loss in four q but did not have as good of course the first quarter of last year so i think it is just to put into context yes it was a certainly above average quarter of supply and trading in the downstream but there was lot of other things going other side of the downstream as well and i think
to fan and his team reacted early to what they could see in terms of what was happening with refining margins and got after further cost efficiencies and also good reliability through the quarter so if you think about the balance for downstream in the first quarter i think half with just on the half we came from supply and trading but actually half we came from lower costs and better operations of
the kit so i think that is kind of important i think there is a components of our supply and trading result jon which you alluding to which is actually that business has changed a huge amount in the last five to ten years where there is actually a base level of business inside there now that actually reduces the risk around the volatility of that going forward and maybe we will try through this year maybe to illuminate
that through future quarters in terms of maybe just some of the activities would be physical nature of that business that actually has more of a margin component it like a fuels business rather than what you think is trading in terms of cash neutrality yes the intent as we lay down in october included the script of course that gives us some flexibility there is no intense at this point
to get back in terms of what we off in the way of script that is a matter for a board and for our shareholders it is something our shareholders like we had a very big script uptick in the first quarter for two thousand and fifteen the script uptick was around about nine percent from memory for one q it was just over forty percent so it was there is a big trance of our shareholders like the script as an alternative
so i do not think there is any intense at this point to withdraw that however we do recognize that then dilutes our shareholders so that is why we say in terms of cash neutrality we would look to want to offset that script at some point in the future and you have seen the buyback program we had in place prior to the drop in the oil price but that would be a matter for the board going forward on capex
and cost deflation it is really across the piece and yeah you are just taking to bernard in terms of the activities that he can say and what is happening on each one of the projects even with projects where we in development an eighty percent of the design and kit is built into the price already there is still being opportunities for us to get back and renegotiate
twenty percent of the final cost so it is really across the piece and i will save a little bit a part of the bernard liked this year and i know jess is talking about upstream invested day at some point this year ideally in the first half of the year and i think bernard and the team will be able to give you a lot of flavor around what we are seeing but it really is lectured as we sound how to review with the
bernard and his team a few weeks back and we went through at least six or seven different projects where there are lots of components of examples where hundred and fifty million dollars has been taken out through eleven wells it want specific development that we are looking at how a hundred million dollars of that is been booked already and fifty million dollars also followed but it is just across the piece jon right okay thank you and thanks jon
we will take a question now from rob west of red burn right thanks very much i will up to relatively financial the one that is one is on the business economic loss payments should we expect it to continue running this quarter to six hundred million dollars run rate in the coming quarters for twenty sixteen and if it does do we burn through
the entire overhang of the all payments by the end of the year my second question on the commodity price assumptions that using to manage the business so clearly the break evens have come down again today are we driving any read across that so the long run ninety dollar oil price assumptions
going into the impairment test and when would you look again it those thank you on the later question we do not use ninety ninety is the long term assumption so we use the forward cure for the next five years and then ninety k so we will be looking at our long term price assumption this year so actually most of our project that went economic today
sixty dollars a barrel in terms of those options that are coming forward to our resource commitment committee today on the bell assumptions this is a quarter where we agreed with the p s c and the facility to simplify the claims to accelerate claims to look to what was the final completion termination of that facility on a faster timeline than we were on
that is let you lower administration cost but of course the higher number of claim so we sort of very large number of claims go through this quarter hence the six hundred million dollars we kind of this point actually given what is left in the facility provide provision around future bell claims and we will continue to update this quarter but maybe just anecdotally to help you what is publically available
is that we are now over two thirds of the way through processing claims in that facility at the hundred and forty seven thousand claims submitted ninety nine thousand have been finalized by the c s s p where thirty nine thousand offers were made and fifty nine thousand that were closed with no payments so that kind of gives you a flavor what i am so far but there are still forty eight thousand claims that progress through that facility and it is impossible from the work that we have looked out and what we
seeing to come up with it this stage of best estimate what that provision looks like going forward but we will continue to update that each quarter very clear thanks thank you and over to guy baber now from simmons thank you very much so like the acquisition were highlighted
objective look at the slide deck where in the portfolio or in the market might there be opportunity add to the portfolio here what is the criteria on what you will screen for acquisitions and i know you guys have constantly looking at lot of assets all the time and how would you characterize the current amana market as it stands
right now okay so the amana market stands right now in the upstream as there is lot of assets out there available i think one of the overwriting principals and it comes all the way back to october two thousand eleven is this concept that making sure that its value and is value accretive for our shareholders so we have looked across the market we have looked at various options around infill asset
acquisition around existing positions that we have or strategic infill options for us i think the key test has to be accretive for shareholders the things are dilate if and really question why you be using your cash on that so we have done small acquisitions we have done some last quarter we mentioned some in the lower forty eight that we did around some of our existing
positions in the san juan basin and we will continue to look at where we can see an asset acquisition where we believe we can add value typically we made with the operator or deepening in those positions or indeed actually looking at swap options but it is being pretty tough to actually find things which are value accretive in the current market and there are a lot of assets up for sale right now so we will continue to look and see and actually as i said last
quarter we did do some small acquisitions we have deepened in one of two positions where with the operator and we will continue to look at those options going forward thanks brian and then i had a one follow up you have highlighted the ninety five percent reliability for your upstream operated assets and the improvements you have made in the underlying upstream operations have been impressive and important to the
profitability what steps are you taking how are you ensuring that progress does it begin to erode in an environment where you are materially cutting back on your spinning levels assuming are cutting back some into the day spending and where you are letting people go as well is that a risk that you guys
are focused on addressing or that you see it sounds like a great question and the thing everything starts with no compromise on safety it is the overall thing guiding principal that we have done for everything and that actually guided us through two thousand ten through the ten point plan through what we lay down for you two years ago and actually what you are seeing through these results and the absolute
correlation between reliability all the way back to safety is very clearly there and you can see it through the results and you will hear bernard talk about that you will hear lamar talk about it you will hear to fan talk about it bob always lays it out in terms of everything we do it is the overwriting piece it is the kind of the safe
place that we go back to is safety being the absolute number one priority and of course that leads to a good reliability of the kit and if you think about the number of turnarounds we went through in two thousand eleven something like forty eight turnarounds in eleven thirty five in twelve something like twenty three twenty four in two thousand thirteen we are back to much more stable steady state now in terms of those turnarounds
but that is absolutely whether the liability is conforming in terms of the kit thanks brian and right back in the uk henry tarr from goldman sachs hi and thanks for taking my question i just want to get back to irene is question on capex if oil prices did remain low and you considered activity reduction in the environment how would you sort of split to prioritize between major project deferrals
and lower spend on ongoing existing production and then if capex spend where to come lower would you still expect that sort of two percent are the lower part of the decline rate on the base production looking into two thousand seventeen yeah i think that is get tough and actually once you get out to sort of seventeen you are probably back in the three percent to five percent historical average in terms of decline
and the two percent i talked about really in the context of two thousand sixteen so i think it gets difficult once you get down to fifteen billion dollars and what we see today and today is portfolio because at that point we started look in terms of future growth out to twenty twenty and twenty twenty one and it is important that we continue to reinvest into the future and that is really we are at this point you would have questions around all components the financial
frame that you would need to look at based on all the fundamentals of what we see around supply and demand today i think that is unlikely but nevertheless if that is what transpires and we find ourselves in two thousand sixteen in the oil prices where is today then we will have decisions to take around all components of the financial frame and i think bob said in the last quarter we are not going to drive the bus off the cliff on the basis
of everything being fixed in the financial frame we would have to look at all components of that okay that is great and i just had one follow up on deflation and how you think about deflation generally and how much is being driven by f x and is there a cyclical services cost reduction component in there or would you
see the bulk of the cost coming out now is secular yeah i think there was f x benefits we saw last year that that was actually weakened against most currencies other than the u k pound which is more a phenomenon of the various issues going around the u k around europe right now so i think the dollar itself actually through the quarter weaken slightly versus other currencies so we are not really seeing forex come through and deflation is sort of one of those strange i know lamar talked about this on previous
calls but deflation is not something that just sort of arrives on your doorstep it is something you have to work out you have to work with the contractors and you have renegotiate right you have to look at your activity you have to find more efficient ways of working and i think if you go back certainly from previous comments we have said about two thirds of the savings that we are seeing coming through in the upstream from self help and about a third is from deflation that deflation is actually from renegotiating contracts of course there is a components if the rig if you look at
the water rigs there is no questions the rates have come down by fifty percent compared to where a couple of years ago and that of course feed into the underlying cost base okay that is great thank you thanks henry we will take the next question from oswald clint if sanford bernstein
yes hi maybe just a question on u s gas please i think you have said previously about a two dollar kind of henry hub breakeven price can you maybe just give us an update on that price point please brian thank you well i think that is probably a cash breakeven price and probably maybe probably two dollars a barrel right in terms of earnings it is more like closer to three and three fifty in terms of oil portfolio is today that is after the work that dave lawler and his team has
done in terms of bringing the costs down quite significantly in terms of our activity in the lower forty eight but i think a breakeven earnings number will be closer to three fifty cash breakeven will be much lower than that which reflects a sort of activity that would doing in the lower forty eight over the last five quarters
okay thank you thanks oswald ah nick haq of ex anne go ahead ah nick hi i am thinking it is just a very quick question on refining i think you have highlighted brian as well that you are expecting a heavy turnaround in q two if i look back over the last at least couple of years i think refining availability has been quite high so i just wondered
how we should think about by quarter on quarter in terms of refining availability in q two yeah i think we are seeing certainly some of the refiners out there cutting runs right now we are not doing that and i think it really comes back to where your refinery is positioned in terms of the barrel and the margins available to those refineries i think
we are now down to about ten operated refineries in last time i counted most of those refineries are well upgraded have good margins available for me through these down times so we have not seen any run cuts of our own in our own system but we are all seeing run cuts across other refineries and other refine
certainly in the first quarter i think refining margins look pretty robust now we have come in seeing one q two thousand sixteen was the lowest we have seen in since two thousand ten so it was actually quite a tough quarter a lot of that driven by diesel and distal demand we have now come through that and we are seeing margins that recover already this quarter to about twelve point seventy quarter to date and they are looking pretty robust
as commence the driving season but right now we are not looking at run cuts thanks ah nick and we will take the next question from anish kapadia of t p h hi i had couple of questions please
first i was just wondering if you could give small update on where you are with some of your f i d is decisions was kind of driving you are thinking so things like mad dog hopkins and tang uh for this year and then the second one just thinking about acquisitions again you know given your long terms planning assumptions of eighty dollars barrel real and five dollars
henry hub and there is quite the opportunities rising in the current market i was wondering would you consider cutting the dividends to do a large acquisition that you believe to be long term value accretive to b p shareholders i will come back to that so on f i d is specifically
now is not the time announce what we are doing at mad dog phase two but i will be looking forward to the quarter where we can talk about the f i d having been done but i would expect there will sometime notwithstanding what we are with partners towards the end of this year i think that is something bob alluded to on the last call when we talked about four q results in terms of the hopkins well we are in appraisal of that well and looking at where we go with it next on the other developments we had
four f i d is last year the other potential f i d this year that mad dog faced to will be around the tang uh expansion that we have talked about before on train three and that is something that we are looking at this year in terms of acquisitions and dividend and financial frame i think everything comes back to the financial frame and how we balance all the various components of that
frame up the dividend is just one component of the frame as is the capital as is the cost base and it is actually relatively small component in comparison i think the key is provided we can get things back into balance next year which is what we would anticipate now certainly as we have seen the costs frame up from being close to seven billion dollars coming down to
actually seven billion the resetting of where the capital frame is i think we have a lot of flexibility within the financial frame we have a lot of capacity in terms of cash on the balance sheet if we were to look at those but as i said earlier there is nothing at this point that we see to be accretive for shareholders that we look to pursue
great thank you alright thank you so we do have a question coming in on the web from nikesh patel of the wesleyan assurance society if the market re balances quickly above sixty dollars a barrel would you increase capital above seventeen billion or would you remain conservative
i think we have flexibility as the price begins the firm which we would expect by the end of this year and then into next year we still even at the end of this year assuming things start to rebalance in the second half of the year that way we have described it will still take probably a year to work through the access capacity so i would not i mean let us just assume that moves back to something
around sixty a barrel and therefore we have surplus cash available then there is no question that replaces where we can ramp up activity relatively in short order in places like the lower forty eight in terms of the drilling program oman khazzan oman exploration iraq alaska there are places where we can look to relatively easy ramp up drill rigs that we have available in terms of activity
but we are not going to try and get into boom and bust we have to get it back to the basics of what are the long term growth options that we see we have a number of significant projects coming on stream in the second half of seventeen we have then a long list of projects that we will be looking to f i d and appraise in terms of eighteen nineteen and twenty but we would not be looking to significantly ramp it up if we set oil prices come back to sixty it would be really be around what we do
at the prefer of the existing portfolio thanks brian and we will take a question now from chris coup lent of bank of america hello moms i am going to make it quick and probably quite boring brian if i may ask you to update us on your two thousand sixteen outlook on all those rather pedestrian items like depreciation production maybe you can give us
numbers on the gulf of mexico payment schedule as well as your effective tax rate that would be greatly appreciated thanks okay chris so effective tax rate will be lower this year than what it was last year it has a lot of moving parts around the tax rate i mean it is coming quite low this quarter i think it s below twenty percent the effective tax rate for one q
but i would expect it to be lower than last year is really the any guidance we can give you in terms of production we laid out for you already that we expect it to be broadly flat with two thousand fifteen d d and a again broadly flat with fifteen although beyond that i would then expect to start to see some of the projects
come on stream in seventeen that there will be a slight uptick in d d and a but certainly for sixteen i would expect it to be flat at around i think around about fifteen billion dollars around slightly more than that o b and c charges will be laid out for you about three hundred million dollars a quarter it is quite low this quarter there is lots of moving parts again in that figure but i think most of it you should find chris
on the website on the presentation right thank you and thanks chris next question from neil morton of investec thank you good afternoon two questions please you mentioned in previous calls brian that you were in the process of renegotiating well services costs i just wondered what progress you had made by end of the first quarter and whether those
those benefits were included in the four point six billion number you mentioned and then just secondly on gearing is maybe nitpicking but back in february you talked about managing gearing around the twenty percent level now you have gone back to the old band whole house change is it simply the core settlement or is it anything else changed in terms of the trajectory of oil
prices piece of disposals et cetera thank you yes so in terms of well services i mean it is across the piece but maybe one particular occasion but we have completed attender we have eighty percent of the well services scope is already be competitively bid with twenty percent still to be renegotiated and we have seen a fifteen percent reduction in well services spend in that particular location that would just one example but there are many across the piece that
bernard and the team can lay out for you later this year in terms of the gearing it was really it was as you just alluded to was it was convenient to run a ten percent to twenty percent strategy when we did because it was not only just the issues around macondo it was also the oil price outlook where we have been pretty bearish since the middle of fourteen two thousand and fourteen in particular where we expected a correction not as big as we
sold but certainly a correction but now that we have the consent decree as final and it is now done in terms of the courts approving that it seemed absolutely logical that we went back to the old band and actually we have got a lot of push from our investors to say why we have gone back to the twenty percent to thirty percent band because even at thirty percent that still gives us a huge amount of flexibility not that we have any intent of going anywhere near that this year
but the idea that you are back in the twenty percent to thirty percent band make complete sense given that now the vast majority of exposure around macondo is it is not only taking care of in terms of that one legal settlement which caused a huge amount of components of the macondo liabilities that created the uncertainty that move in the lower end of the range but it was also the certainty that we now had in place a plant to rebalance the portfolio
going forward at this new lower oil price set so it and i think it resonates with investors where feeding better just a follow up on the costs when you are signing new contracts are the sort of price concessions you achieve are they typically time limited or the contracts linked to the oil price it depends on what the nature of
of the contract is some of them those contracts are linked obviously to oil price in terms of how you recover that capital and some not and those benefits typically would not go into the seven billion target in twenty seventeen no just to be clear because actually that is more on the capital side in terms of what you are asking about then in terms of the costs it will be across the piece so the cost there benefits coming from headcount activities
renegotiations of contracts it is across the piece but some of them to run well service a lot of that is capitalized great thank you thanks neill turning now to lucas herrmann of deutsche yeah afternoon brian and thanks for your time and sorry about saturday as well three if i may quickly first one in terms of divestments they are becoming increasingly small
it is increasingly difficult i think in our side to try and assess what the cash associated or the income associated with the assets you are selling is ensure how should we think about the cash or the income that you are foregoing or the obligations you are taking on if you stop to dive if you divest more assets if there are indeed any secondly provisions spent on restructuring when you do actually expect it to end
is two thousand and sixteen sort of predominantly you are going to see an end to it and two thousand and seventeen will be relatively clean and thirdly as we go through this period where a number of businesses are probably in tax loss how much tax upside is there as profits starts to recover and you find those profits are sheltered
okay lucas so and thank you for the comments about saturday and i am sure most people would not know what you are talking about but that is very much appreciated in terms of divestments there is some operating cash with them but they are nothing like as accretive as they were historically just think about where the oil price is so and those midstream assets and some of those downstream assets that we have talked about
some operating cash has gone but nothing like at the same level that we divested and that big first trounce of the seventy five billion in terms of provisions we have to each quarter look at what the carrying value is of all of the assets i presume you are alluding to the things around macondo provisions that we take in this quarter no i am really referring to restructuring and trying to think okay in seventeen how clean is it and to what extent we are going to see the full benefit of the
restructuring savings not breaking level that are coming through either there would not be offset by a billion or so of restructuring charges yeah so it is probably second half of seventeen will be the first time you will see a clear set of costs with both normal provisions so i expect actually i would expect the bulk of the provisions to be cleared out through this year however there will be some potential cash that flows out with those provisions in the first half of seventeen as people leave
the organization towards the back end of the year and cash payments go out in the first half of next year i would expect probably two q has been the earliest next year where you get a clean set of costs and cash numbers coming through so there is a hidden benefits if you like coming through each quarter because of course cash payments are going out each quarter affecting our pricing cash flow and they all
come back in the end of the second half of seventeen yeah and then in terms of taxes yes you are right actually we have got a number of tax credits that we are carrying forward in the moment in the key is how we utilize those deferred tax credits but as we see recovery in the environment through the second half of this year we are comfortable that those tax credits will get fully
utilized going forward okay so brian thanks very much and thanks lucas a question now from brendan warn of b m o yeah thanks jess so brian most of my questions have been answered but just follow up and you probably answered in saying oil projects starting sixteen and seventeen are on track but just no specific comments
on thunder horse you can just give us an update on those two projects please yeah actually on track we are ahead of schedule but thunder horse is the south expansion i presumably talked about and water injection and on those right now we are let me just come back on south expansion right now the facilities
progress is about nearly fifty percent complete just below fifty percent and fabrication for critical path manifold and the sled is ahead of plan and on the water injection last time we looked at it it was ahead of plan in term of where we were but i will have to come back to on the specifics of where we are in terms of developments of that okay thanks i have level at there thanks for your time thanks
brendan and we will follow up with you on that thomas adolf of credit suisse hi thanks for taking my questions i have got two on project execution please firstly if i take the i p a statistic and they basically said the industry has destroyed value versus initial expectations on
on seventy five percent of all projects completed in the last decade on a price normalized basis they also said in total the value loss relative to project planning assumption has been around thirty five percent so i wondered how b pees performance has been versus the initial budget over the past
ten years that is the first question the second question again on project execution and i am focusing here on current developments i spent just over two weeks recently in asia was lot of fun but some of the feedback around shipyards did not sound very very encouraging versus the
the messaging we get from corporate generally for the industry so i wondered whether you see further risk on project delivery especially those project where where you know some work has been done at some of your south korean shipyards beyond clair ridge assuming the information flow from the bottom to the top works as they should and also regarding shah deniz phase two i
i understand and i might be wrong here one of your partners has struggled to secure some funding related to the pipeline if that is that the case are you still comfortable everything is in line with your expectations thank you very much okay thomas so let me let me work my way through those these questions so the first one i would say simply that in the latter part of the last decade our performance is significantly better than
better than it was in the first part of the last decade in terms of project execution and in terms of the stats that you quoted we were probably as certainly on average as bad in terms of that the way you have laid those stat out as anybody else in the sector we put in place in two thousand and nine a centralized project
organization which really i think we talked about this on previous calls really got into action over those subsequent years but particularly two thousand and eleven was the big year that that projects organization really got after the fifteen big projects we talked about around the ten point plan the majority of which with the exception of one or two for different reasons were delivered on time on budget
and right now i could layout for you every one of our projects where we are in terms of specific execution versus everything else that we laid out and i think one of the things that you have heard lamar talk about and bernard in particular since that project organization here we saw a lot of that was really around how you front end load the activity ahead of time in terms of planning and scheduling activity so in terms of your specific question
and in terms of where we are on the execution for existing projects a lot better in the last five years than the previous five then your next question i will come to back shah deniz phase two that is probably the easiest one to take next actually now you are asking about korean shipyards on the korean shipyards actually specifically this example you had in terms of clair ridge last time we looked we have got five all five
modules are on their way from korea on route to the west of shetlands and we have no issues around that right now but i do understand some of the constraints that are out there in terms of the shipyards and the activity certainly what we could see about eighteen months ago was there was a lot of stacking of activity in terms of getting all the projects through that were being lined up through some of those shipyards but we do not see any major problems right now around the existing projects and then in terms of
shah deniz phase two that is progressing really well right now in terms of where we are if there are other partner issues there then really the question that you should ask those partners not ourselves but so far shah deniz phase two is progressing really well and to your exact question we are about seventy one percent versus completion versus sixty percent is what the plan
i would say okay thank you and just a quick follow up come up thomas you just had three question so what do you mean a follow up okay fair enough fair enough fair enough thank you no go ahead please no no please now go ahead you understand that the industry is working to get better at executing projects and you know front end loading is a key component to that because you have highlighted i wondered given that no one is taking any f i dees at the moment
for various reasons would it not be the perfect time to be really doing projects because you get the best teams you get excess of all the best shipyards et cetera et cetera as opposed to waiting until everyone comes back and then actually the prices recover as well i mean yeah that is a really good question and actually on that respect we are not trying to catch the low here in terms of
of rates for activity but there is no question i think the pause at mad dog phase two is probably the best example of this the pause that we did around in number of projects to go back and re engineer re scope reschedule and re contract some of the activity has led to yes the projects moving sideways but the economics and therefore the value to shareholders significantly being better but equally we do not want to be sitting around
waiting for the absolute low low low before we go f i d so i think it is a fair push to say that actually was sort of in that window right now mad dog phase two is a good example of that okay thank you very much alright and we will have a question from bee raj bock ah tar ia of r b c
hi thanks for taking my questions i had a couple if i may one going back to the lower forty eight we are seeing cost go down like q on q i was wondering if you could comment or talk about how that business is performing relative to the rest of your portfolio in terms of efficiency gains and productivity is up faster or slower in terms of those gains and the second question would be on oman there were some reports over the last month of
or so about a potential gas pipeline between iran and oman to be built and i was wondering if you could talk about the potential implications for the khazzan project if there is an issue there thanks i think the latter one is difficult to talk about until something actually gets announced but there is no question if there is oman khazzan is progressing
is progressing really well developments is going incredibly well and we now expect to drill i think last summer we reviewed this will bernard eighty five fewer wells compared to the original scope that we had in place so that would obviously be an opportunity but that is not something i can comment on without having knowing the specifics of whether actually was to go ahead in terms of the pipeline and then in terms of
lower forty eight you will first of all again bob and lamar and bernard have talked about this historically yeah this is more of a manufacturing business so it is a little bit different to a offshore facility and in a full offshore development that means you can take the rigs up much quicker you can also bring those rigs back down again there is no question though that bringing dave lawler and his team and the re engineering of that business
the move to get off the main west complex the restructuring of the people inside that business and the refocusing of the engineers back on the field developments has led to all of the improvements that you can see that we know publish each quarter in terms of the drilling costs coming down the cost of production coming down
and so difficult to replicate versus oh say deepwater type alternative but there is no question actually lower forty eight creates for us huge advantage in other options that we look like in our onshore developments like oman khazzan potentially maybe around china shale that we have announced recently but we that is an important part as an asset base for the company
in terms of the technology that we develop inside that we deploy elsewhere in the world that is great thanks thanks bee raj and we have a late entry and so last but certainly not least from jason kenney of santander hi brian thanks for hanging on for this question just looking at some longer term energy semantics
and you just mentioned china shale there so i wonder if you could give us some insight on the scale of the price and the potential commitment from b p over the next few years and is it going to be game changing in the same way that us saw a turnaround over a decade in its gas markets anytime soon and the second on global l n g are you feeling the need to create demand
a long term l n g i was just wondering what happens to fundamentals over the next five ten years in global l n g well yeah the last question is quite interesting one in terms of where this l n g will go given the number of projects that we see coming on the backend of the decade and certainly over between now and two thousand twenty there is significant amount of l n g
we can see coming on the market in terms of china i can not tell you a lot i am afraid jason other than the fact it is fifteen hundred square kilometers it is in the sichuan basin and it is a great step forward in terms of our cooperation and working with c m p c who will be the operator it ties back to an agreement we put in place back in october in london that bob signed and covers also some of the possible opportunities even it is a field retailing
in china exploration of oil and potentially l n g trading which they are definitely interested in so i think it is a it was a great landmark deals to get done in terms of progressing forward i think it is a little bit early at this point to sort of say what opportunities will flow off the back of that in terms of l n g we will see the first cargo s of gas probably export out of the lower forty eight out of north america
certainly next year we will see our own gas start to export in twenty eighteen i think the whole gas portfolio in the rebalance of gas globally i think you will continue to have the three zones around north america the far eastern europe whether there will be more connectivity as we see more l n g projects
come on i think you will see more l n g pricing into the far east non oil related which we see in certainly in more recent times but there is no question there will be a lot of l n g available on the market we obviously cannot create demand that will be something much will be match ly taken up probably in the far east and potentially in terms of power development if you look at the lower forty eight and the us and you are seeing a lot of industry activity
being built off the lower forty eight gas prices in north america and i would not be surprised to see more of that trend especially in terms of chemicals and manufacturing yeah it is a big topic thanks so much yeah jason we can go on for long time but i think you are now the final question good thanks very much alright thank you everybody that is the end of our questions and i will just hand back to brian to close the call well so first of all thank you for your patience we have tried to cover all of the questions that you had
today just to summarize safety and we talked about the safety reliability remains the number one priority that we have within the firm we have demonstrated that i think continued momentum on costs and capital and repositioning the company to the lower oil prices that we see given it remains a key priority and we have laid out for you how we believe we can balance it to about to fifty to fifty five next year and we look forward to re engaging with you certainly at some point this
year around an upstream investor day and if not then our two q result where we will have our segment heads and bob available for the call well thank you for your patience and time

throughout the quarter we expanded our proprietary product offering while extending our global customer reach laying the foundation for continued growth in two thousand sixteen and beyond our solid first quarter financial results were fueled by the ongoing growth of trading in our proprietary index products it was the third consecutive quarter in which trading in our proprietary products exceeded forty percent of our overall trading volume
futures and index options trading rose seventeen percent sequentially and twenty eight percent year over year significantly outpacing the year over year increase of three percent for multiple listed options traded industry wide today i will update progress made in the four point growth strategy we laid out for you at the beginning of the year which is to continue to develop unique products expand our customer base leverage strategic alliances and continue to define and the lead the options in volatility space globally
product innovation including further developing and expanding our current product line is the cornerstone of our growth strategy c b o e's s and p five hundred index s p x options continue to thrive and grow after posting a third consecutive year of record growth in two thousand fifteen average daily volume in s p x options for the first quarter two thousand sixteen rose fifteen percent from both the same period of last year and the previous quarter the gains were driven largely by strong weekly trading which continues to attract new customers to our s p x marketplace
building on the growing demand for s p x weeklies trading we launched wednesday weeklies on february twenty third wednesday expiring weeklies combined with our standard s p x weeklies which feature end of week expirations create additional trading opportunities and enable investors to better target specific expirations
wednesday weeklies is also aligned with the wednesday expirations of vix weeklies futures and options creating new trading opportunities and synergies for the growing number of customers who employee both vix and s p x products we are pleased with the initial traction seen thus far wednesday weeklies averaged sixty three thousand contracts daily in march the products first full month of trading and over seventy one thousand contracts through april twenty second with a single day high of a one hundred and twenty three thousand contracts
given the appeal of wednesday weeklies we plan to seek s e c approval to add monday expiring weeklies which will allow investors to hedge their over the weekend risks we expect trading growth to continue as we roll out marketing and educational programs highlighting our new s p x weeklies products
this past quarter c b o e created a series of c b o e s and p five hundred buffer protect indexes that are designed to track the performance of an investment strategy combining a ten percent downside loss buffer with upside participation capped at a targeted level our buffer protect indexes bring a new level of standardization and transparency to popular protection oriented payoffs and facilitate the creation of products that allow investors to pre define their investment outcomes
c b o e began the settling daily values for the buffer protect indexes on april first that financial group and asset management firm that provides option based investments through structured protective strategies and innovative technology solutions is the first to license the new indexes
you will recall that earlier this year c b o e made a majority equity investment in vest which now plans to use the buffer protect indexes to create products that are expected to be available through a number of full service broker dealer platforms we view target outcome investing as an important step democratizing the use of options as it can offer the benefits but substantially reduces the complexity of options for retail and high net worth individuals
we recognize that all investors are not the same some are attracted to short dated weeklies contracts while others have a time horizon of a year or more and favor buy and hold investment solutions our expertise in developing option based strategy performance benchmark index combined with our partnership with vest provides c b o e with a unique advantage point for which to define and leave target outcome investing in the options space
turning now to vix futures and options elevated volatility at the start of two thousand sixteen drove significant increases in vix trading in the first quarter average daily volume in vix options trading rose fifty five percent over the first quarter of two thousand fifteen and twenty percent over the prior quarter average daily volume in vix futures trading was up sixteen percent year over year and fifteen percent over the previous quarter heightened levels of volatility tapered off throughout the quarter eventually falling below historic level a levels by the quarters end and into april
in other vix news we began overnight dissemination of the vix index on april fifteenth as you know vix measures the real time implied volatility of the s and p five hundred options our implementation of our fully electronic market for s p x options during extended trading hours that 's two a m to eight fifteen p m central not only provides increased access to s p x trading but also enables us to calculate and disseminate vix index values in that same period
we are thrilled to offer market participants the opportunity to view volatility when used breaks overnight through the same lens used in regular u s trading hours we expect that increased access to real time volatility information coupled with the ability of overseas investors to reference the vix index during their regular trading hours will drive increased fixed trading in a global marketplace
turning now to trading and ftse russell index products you will recall that c b o e became a sole u s provider of major ftse russell index products in two thousand fifteen beginning with the russell two thousand index rut options in april in the first quarter of two thousand sixteen rut trading at c b o e was up five percent over the first quarter of two thousand fifteen when rut options were still multi listed and up eighteen percent from the previous quarter
on march twenty ninth we listed options on two additional ftse russell indexes the ftse one hundred and the ftse china fifty enabling investors to gain exposure to the largest and most liquid segments of the u k and chinese equity markets the new ftse options add to the growing international dimension of our index options franchise which began with the launch of m s c i products
i should note that following sustained marketing and educational efforts we are encouraged to see early trading in our m s c i index products and believe we can build on that growth going forward c b o e continues to leverage the marketing and education efficiencies afforded by a comprehensive suite of c b o e index options and volatility products
we plan in two thousand sixteen to further leverage our concentrated index option liquidity pool while expanding our global customer base through joint marketing and educational efforts with our index provider partners last week we took a major step forward in broadening the global reach of vix futures trading by establishing connectivity between c f e our futures exchange and stellar trading systems a major independent software vendor in europe and asia
stellar specializes in providing low latency solutions for high volume traders our connectivity with c q g trading technologies and now stellar trading connections c f e to the worlds top futures execution programs significantly expanding our customer reach and bringing new efficiencies to vix futures trading globally
we are now planning our fifth annual c b o e risk management conference in europe r m c europe which will take place september twenty sixth to twenty eighth in county wicklow ireland i am pleased to say we are preparing to open our c b o e london office our first business development outpost in july in addition we have engaged a full time c b o e consultant based in hong kong in order to have boots on the ground to support our ongoing business development efforts in asia
i will close here by saying we are obviously pleased with our strong first quarter results and while overall volume at april dropped from those first quarter highs we continue to see increased trading of vix futures and we accomplished several key strategic objectives regardless of the macro environment our team remains focused on developing new products expanding our customer base and leveraging strategic alliances
this disciplined approach positions our company to optimally benefit from trading tailwinds and continue to lay the foundation for future growth when faced with headwinds so i will end here by thanking our team for their ongoing commitment to advancing our strategic plan regardless of market conditions it is their focus that enables c b o e to continue to define and lead the options and volatility space globally and thereby best serve our customers and shareholders over the long term
with that i will turn it over to alan dean thanks ed and good morning everyone let me start with an overview of our first quarter results strong trading volume in our proprietary products for the quarter drove solid first quarter results operating revenue came in at one hundred and sixty two point three million dollars fourteen percent above last years first quarter
adjusted operating income was eighty point six million dollars representing an adjusted operating margin of forty nine point seven percent up one hundred bases points compared with forty eight point seven percent in the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was forty nine point nine million dollars up eighteen percent versus the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of sixty one cents a twenty two percent increase compared with fifty cents per share for the same period last year
before i continue let me point out that our gap results reported for the first quarter of two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and fifteen include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance these items are detailed in our non gap information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck looking at our results further starting with operating revenue we reported increases in transaction fees and exchange services and other fees partially offset by a decrease in other revenues
higher transaction fees accounted for most of the revenue growth in the quarter up nineteen point three million dollars or twenty percent compared with the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen resulting from a nineteen percent increase in the average revenue per contract or r p c versus last years first quarter total trading volume was relatively unchanged from two thousand and fifteen first quarter
looking at volume by product category you can see there are higher r p c proprietary products significantly outperformed the lower r p c multiply listed options with trading in our index options up twenty nine percent and futures up sixteen percent over last years first quarter these increases were offset by lower volume and equity options and options on exchange rate of products which decreased twenty percent and five percent respectively
our blended r p c including options and futures increased to forty point five cents from thirty four cents cents in last years first quarter the increase in r p c primarily reflects a favorable shift in the mix of trading volume with our highest r p c products and ex options of future contracts accounting for forty two point four percent of trading in the first quarter up from thirty three point three percent in the same period last year
the r p c in our options business increased to thirty four point six per six cents compared with twenty eight point four cents in the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen largely due to the favorable mix of trading volume furthermore the r p c for equity options and index options increased ten percent and one percent respectively primarily a result of lower volume discounts and incentives
revenue per contract at c f e our futures exchange decreased four percent to nearly a dollar sixty four from a dollar seventy in last years first quarter reflecting the impact of higher rebates linked to volume and account type looking at the sequential change in r p c the blended r p c for the first quarter was down slightly from forty point eight cents in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting higher volume related discounts and a shift in the mix of trading volume with index options
engaging r p c going forward keep in mind that the r p c varies by index option and changes in a mix of volume by product traded impacts the average r p c for that category the revenue contribution from our proprietary products continues to increase as a percentage of our total transaction fees
in the first quarter proprietary products accounted for eighty five point eight percent of our transaction fees up from eighty one point three percent in the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen and eighty three point one percent in the fourth quarter of two thousand and fifteen looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue exchange services and other fees increased by one point seven million dollars this increase was largely due to revenue contributed from c b o e live vol technology services which became part of c b o e holdings on august seven two thousand and fifteen
additionally other revenue was down by one point seven million dollars primarily due to a flow of revenue from fines in two thousand and fifteen revenue from fines was higher than normal particularly in the first three quarters of the year which could result in more difficult comparisons and other revenue in future quarters
revenue from fines is pulled with regulatory revenue and is used towards expenses as we incur to support our regulatory functions turning to expenses this next slide details total adjusted operating expenses of eighty one point seven million dollars for the quarter and increase of eight point four million dollars or eleven percent compared with seventy three point three million dollars in last years first quarter operating expenses for the quarter reflect higher costs for royalty fees compensation and benefits professional fees and outside services and depreciation and amortization
core operating expenses were fifty point nine million dollars and increase of three million dollars or six percent compared with the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen this increase primarily reflects higher costs of one point five million dollars in compensation and benefits and one point three million dollars in professional fees and outside services
the increase in compensation and benefits largely reflects higher incentive based compensation which is the line with our improved financial performance the variance in professional fees and outside services primarily reflects higher costs for legal and other professional services we are reaffirming our guidance with core expenses for the year to be in the range of two hundred and eleven to two hundred and fifteen million dollars we do expect core expenses to increase some on the back half of this year
we noted in our previous earnings call under the regulatory services agreement with finra we plan to complete our migration to finra regulatory software in july resulting in an increase in fees for outside services while this increase is expected to be offset somewhat by lower depreciation and amortization expenses due to the final write off of certain regulatory software it does shift some expenses into core in the third and fourth quarters that were previously in depreciation and amortization
in addition i want to call your attention to the fact that we added accelerated stock based compensation to our guidance we expect to recognize its r rated stock based compensation expense on a quarterly bases totaling one million dollars for the full year this expense is expected to be reported in compensation and benefits and included in our non gap reconciliation as an adjusted financial measure
the accelerated investing of certain equity awards is based on planned participants reaching age and service requirements specified under our long term incentive plan and award agreements looking at volume based expenses royalty fees increased by four point nine million dollars or thirty five percent reflecting the higher trading volume and licensed products during the quarter
the royalty rate per license contract came in at fifteen point five cents this quarter below the sixteen point one cents we saw in the fourth quarter resulting from a slight shift in the mix of products traded looking forward i would expect the rate per license contract to be somewhere within the range we saw in two thousand and fifteen of fourteen point six and sixteen point three cents depending on the mix of products traded
before i move off of the p and l i want to comment on other income and expenses which had a favorable variance of nine hundred thousand dollars on an adjusted bases compared to last years first quarter this primarily reflects a seven hundred thousand dollars increase in investment income largely resulting from a higher dividend paying out by the options clearing corporation o c c versus the amount declared in the fourth quarter
turning to the balance sheet we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of one hundred and seven million dollars compared to one hundred and two million dollars at the end of two thousand and fifteen c b o e is a strong cash producing business in the first quarter we generated net cash flows from operating activities of ninety seven million dollars versus seventy eight million dollars in the same period last year largely driven by the increase in net income through march we use more than ninety million dollars to pay dividends and nearly forty seven million dollars to repurchase our stock
capital expenditures for the quarter were nine million dollars looking out to the end of the year we are reaffirming our prior guidance of forty seven to forty nine million dollars for capital spending the majority of our capital spending continues to be systems related particularly with the ongoing development of our new trading platform cboe vector as we told you previously vector is planned to be up and running for our futures exchange cfe towards the end of the third quarter and we look forward to continuing the development of vector for cboe and c two
at march thirty first two thousand and sixteen we had approximately one hundred and fifteen point one million dollars remaining under our existing shares repurchase authorization as we said in the past first and foremost we are committed to investing in the growth of our business then we look to return excess cash to shareholders through sustainable dividends and share repurchases
holding we are pleased with our solid financial performance for the first quarter and are optimistic about the opportunities we see ahead as we continue to focus on deploying cash generated and value enhancing ways to reward our shareholders with that we thank you for your time and attention this morning i will turn it back over to debbie for instructions on the q and a portion of our call good point we would be happy to take questions we ask you to limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone fell free to get back in the q and if time permits we pick a second question operator
yes thank you as mention we will now begin the question and answers section to ask a question you may press star and then one on your touch tone phone if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your hand set before pressing the keys to dry your question please press star and then two sorry we pause momentarily to assemble our roster and the first question comes from rich repeat o with sandler o kneel
good morning ed good morning alan hi rich morning rich i guess the multi listed market share question again so you had an uptick in the first quarter you know due to the pricing adjustments but in april its ticked down again and
im just trying to see your outlook on this you know its below fifteen percent of transaction revenue and you know probably just around ten or eleven percent of overall revenue so do you still regard the multi listed platform market shares you know a priority for you
hey richard thanks for the question yeah there is no question where our position on multiple listed options it is a valuable part of our business it not only provides the transaction fees as you mentioned but supports some other revenue line items as well through the first quarter we ebbed and flow with the number one position we are within tenths of a point of the number one market share position we feel as though we are optimizing revenue which is key for us
so have not seen any significant shifts in flow large block trades which tend to move away from some of the primary markets can account for some shifts in market shares so all in all we feel very good about our market share position and multiple listed options and nothing has changed got it okay and that i know you would express condolences on my bruins and panthers i want to do the same for your black hawks thanks i really appreciate we are a couple of socks town right now we are okay good luck
thank you and that next question comes from michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning guys this is actually sameer on for mike carrier thanks for taking the call you know alan i guess this is more of a question for you given the recent number of acquisitions can you give us an update on your minimal level of cash that you need and also c b o e has had a debt free balance sheet has your philosophy on leverage change given your m m a and capital management needs
thanks good question i am glad you asked it and i appreciate the opportunity to update my thinking on cash and leverage so it really has not changed even with the boltons that we have been acquiring over the last couple of years or so
fifty to seventy million dollars of cash i think is more than adequate to run our business especially with no leverage no debt on our balance sheet which then if we needed to we could go out and borrow money pretty quickly regarding taking on debt on our balance sheet it is a subject that our board takes up every quarter one we discuss
capital allocation and so far our position has not changed we like the flexibility that no leverage no debt gives us on our balance sheet and so as of today no change in that position either perfect thanks again
thank you and the next question comes from alex cram of u b s hey good morning a quick question on the core index franchise so c m e had their earnings maybe you guys watched and they had a very small
bullet on their presentation where they pointed out their s and t options market share has improved couple points year over year versus you guys so i know obviously these are not the same products but they are somewhat substitutes so just a bigger question about what you see out there that is core market of yours are you seeing other substitute products take some share how are you thinking about it how you are pricing that business and what substitute products in your opinion doing better than others like for example o t c versus obviously other sub products c m e products anything you could add would be great thanks
sure alex we are very mindful of the cost between the two complexes and whether or not they can be substitute products and as we have always said from a retail perspective one of the substitutes that certainly comes to mind is the most active e t f trade in the industry so we are always mindful of the cost advantages or disadvantages offered at c b o e
i think its important to point out though in the first quarter where our index complex you know i will throw big speeches in there just for fun its growing twenty eight percent year over year compared to the industry singlest volume growing three percent so this is a very important growth area for us we have seen incredible uptake on the product extensions the most recent and the ones that are weeklies
really only about a month and a half to two months of training big uptake a lot of activity it really led us to the announcement this morning of launching subject to s e c approval monday weekly so we are out there offering answering the demand from our customer side and really do not see a sustained
share loss or drain to the c m e but rather really accommodating much more demand in fine tuning expiration in the listed arena here at c b o e let me just add alex that one of the things we continue to see in our s p x products in particular they are growing
use of the product by retail clients in fact some of the retail firms are among the largest providers of order flow and particularly in the weekly whereas as we had many years ago a product that was absolutely exclusively institutional we have a very very rich mix of both retail and institutional we see that trend continuing yeah and also i think it is important alex to look at the similarly the way that we look at the e t n growth in volatility trading
so look at the c m e growth in options and futures as complementary if the entire complex of the s and p five hundred if that exposures there is more demand globally thats a good thing for c b o e so encouraged by any growth we see in the five hundred not a new contract in the industry but one that continues to grow year over year when compared to the more competitive space that c b o e is in as well
very good thank you thanks thank you and the next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank morning if you can comment a little bit there is obviously new competitor in the market with volatility with the spike index if you can comment on your sort of sensibility on your vix franchise versus the other competitive calculations whether you think that will gain traction
yeah we have heard there is another volatility contract out there but the contract specs are out so we really dont know what that contract is going to look like so until there is specs out its kind of difficult to comment on this is not the first challenge to the volatility franchise i think
vax here in chicago has a contract a couple years ago i f c announced a volatile contract probably about a year ago nothing really in the market and again without the specs for this new contract i am not quite sure what to make of it but said that we have benefitted from the growth of any listed volatility contract in ultimately where the liquidity is in our vix futures and options
so likely if there is any success on any new contract whether it is the one you are referring to or one of the others the traders will have to go where liquidity that is our vix futures and options so we will look to see what the specs look like and kind of make our moves from there okay thank you
thank you and the next question comes from kyle voigt with k b w hi good morning good morning so it looks like you implemented a frequent trader program in april which just gives rebates to end users if they reach certain volume thresholds during given months could you help us understand the thought process here maybe what it potentially helps you in terms of understanding your client base better and then lastly if you could give us any idea of how many clients so it looks like you implemented a frequent trader program in april which gives rebates to end users if they reach certain volume thresholds during given months could you help us understand the thought process here maybe what it potentially helps you in terms of understanding your client base better and then lastly if you could give us any idea of how many clients have signed up for the program already and if you see any impact on fee capture going forward material thanks
so you actually summarized it pretty well it is a program you can set it it is intended to give end user customers the ability to identify themselves through the broker dealer that they route orders through and thus giving us the ability to directly communicate with market to and educate those end users often times we are asked about whether business is incremental how many customers that are using our products are new versus ones that have been with us for many many years and it has never been an easy question to answer because there is a layer
between us and the end user customer that prevents us often from knowing who that is so this is an attempt on our part to create a financial inducement for customers to provide their information through their broker dealer it has been launched we have a good number of clients that have signed up at this point and we will go to the details of those but we are very pleased
with the extent to which customers have shown an interest in participating and again the primary business objective is to promote directly to those clients the existence of our products how to use them and are there information that we can garner on how to improve those products as to the financial implications i will let alan speak to the financials kyle i view this as market data that were purchasing through a discount on our transaction fees i think it has a value to us but the good thing is
that we absolutely control the amount of discount that we give to customers through the acquisition of this market data information so no i do not expect that the discount will be material to our capture and our revenue per contract capture and i would think that in total it would be consistent with what you would expect with any company who might purchase market data information about their customers okay thanks for calling thank you and the next question comes from andrew wong with r b c capital
thank you good morning just following up on our vix futures volumes are technically in line with your strong queue one volumes and we have seen a nice pick up in open interest but trading in vix related e t f has declined somewhat so i know the data you have on the end user is somewhat limited but what do you think is driving the futures growth in quarter to date in queue two in place of the e t f volumes that have been a big driver in the past
the hedging activity of e t n tends to fluctuate with race redemption in the e t n or the e t f so what we have noticed as you know volatility change and the perception of risks change so then does the volume in e t n and e t f i will point out that the assets are growing in the e t n and the e t f so the assets that are captured in those
specific e t n and e t f are growing and as a result those tend to be longer positions that are held longer in the futures some of the options as opposed to like a day trader that you will see in a vix futures contract as amount of volume increases we see a lot of day trader activities so that 's carrying the futures along nicely and then the change in perception of risk over the long term changes the assets under management and e t n and e t f which tend to be longer hold positions in both the futures and the options thanks
thank you and the next question comes from chris harris of wells fargo great good morning guys morning wondering if you can provide your perspectives on the nasdaq s acquisitions of i s e whether you think that is going to lead to a big change in the market abd i believe the plan over there is to lower pricing and so maybe you could speak to how that might potentially affect r b c going forward for your guys
i will let alan tackle what we think will happen in pricing and really from c b o e perspective the value of propositions here does not change at all we have been completion with each of those medallions whether they are owned not part of nasdaq or nasdaq with their existing medallions we compete with them head to head every day that is a very much a fee game and fee competition
but it does not change the c b o e value proposition with ninety nine percent of the market share in broad based indexes the efficiency and scale at c b o e does n t change just because ise is part of nasdaq so from the day to day multi list space it is going to be still head to head in fee game alan can speak to that but in the over all look at c b o e
the way you look c b o e the way our end users looks at c b o e that deep pool of liquidity in the index complex doesnt change just because ise now is part of nasdaq but to the potential fee compression as a result i am sure alan has some words yes chris our outlook on pricing and the multi risk category really has not changed and so not withstanding this acquisition of nasdaq by nasdaq of ise
i dont think anything has changed in price this is a very competitive space with fourteen exchanges all trading the same products we here at c b o e we want every options contract to come here and we are committed to a market leading position in the category ed provo mentioned before about how the
market share in multi list category supports other revenue line items in our p and l so i dont think this acquisition at all changes the landscape as a matter of fact it is possible if i were to buy something i feel some pressure to
make sure i show the results from that investment and so lowering pricing would not be the way to do that i understand that maybe nasdaq might have said they are more efficient now and it will be interesting to see what happens i do not expect anything earth shaking anything new coming out of this acquisition the good news is ross that now eighty five percent of our transaction fees over eighty five percent
emanates from our propriety products and not this multi list category so no i do not see anything new coming out from this acquisition okay appreciate your thoughts thank you and the next question from ken worthington with j p morgan
hi good morning from amanda i was here for ken just touching on the market share of the multi listed options again with the declining market share there and as you mentioned the competitiveness of the space what is the magnitude of pricing changes you think is necessary here for c b o e to maintain or perhaps even gain share
so amanda i want to make sure i understand your question correctly are you asking how far down pricing can go in a multi list category is that what you are saying yeah in your experience with what you have seen so far what type of pricing adjustments do you see as being necessary there well it is
were not a price leader were a price follower and with the objective of maintaining a market leading share or near market leading share in the multi list category r p c is all over the map on exchanges some i have seen some numbers as low as three cents per contract and some past ten upwards of ten or more cents per contract and
so i expect r p c to continue its load decline going down i think it will level off somewhere at some point exchanges will play up they will need a certain level of revenue to support the costs associated with this business is it four cents five cents per contract three six somewhere in that range i would expect thank you for the call
and we do have a follow up question from brian bedell with deutsche bank great thanks for getting my call alan if you can just talk about the r p c trends on sort of volume basis in the index complex obviously index market index options volumes are down almost like twenty percent in april versus the first quarter to what extent i know there is a lot of different moving parts within the index options franchise but to what extent
should we if we stay at that level in the second quarter how do you imagine that would impact the index options r p c index options we averaged seventy two cents per contract traded for the first quarter and looking at it by months it was relatively consistent it was seventy three a little over seventy three cents in january seventy two cents in february and a little above seventy cents in march
and it is very difficult to predict but as a rule of thumb in the big volume amounts you should expect a lower r p c now going forward i think to use seventy two cents what we reported in the first quarter is a pretty you will be pretty close in your model for the rest of the year at seventy two cents i
of course monitor the information that we disseminate about pricing on a monthly basis they are rolling three month average and that should help guide you but no i do not see any major moves in pricing in index r p c if i can just ask one follow up question on the revenue in the fine side alan if you could talk about the calibration of that in other revenue versus expenses how should we think about that
for the second quarter i guess if that remains depressed you know is there an expense offset to that yeah well first of all any revenue that we collect either in fines or in the regulatory revenue category has to goes to support our regulatory efforts so it can not be used for anything else we can not make a profit off of those two revenue sources so it is sort to governing if we thought
fines was going to have a fantastic year we would lower regulatory revenue in concert with that and vice versa fine revenue was extremely difficult to predict and year over year our other revenue was down one point seven million dollars and that was two million dollars was fines year over year and we had an increase in licensing fees to go along with that that offset some of that decrease
i think the experience that we saw in fines in the first quarter was extraordinary i would not expect that to continue the rest of the year and i would say that overtime i would think that we will be closer to it will be higher on average was there an offset in the first quarter or did you we take a longer view of
the fine revenue regulatory revenue rather than a month by month adjustment you know it is a multi quarter even an annual look back to make sure that the revenue that we collect from regulatory sources is adequate given our expenses right that is weaker than we should consider that as a positive to the in other words you can reduce expenses if thats tracking weaker this year based on that
so if total regulatory revenue goes down in two thousand and sixteen that would indicate that our regulatory expenses are down okay okay thank you thank you and next question is also a follow up from chris harris of wells fargo
thanks sorry if this is covered already but just to tag along with the index r p c question any thoughts about the outlook for futures r p c for the remainder of the year yeah i do glad you asked so our revenue per contract was a dollar sixty four and that was kind of all over the map it was a dollar fifty eight in january dollar sixty three in february and a dollar seventy three in march
it was low in january we had the volume the participation of volatility was a great market for high frequency traders for people coming and trading the market and helping to provide markets for that product
and so i think that it was extraordinarily low in january and helped bring down the revenue per contract for the quarter at a dollar sixty four so i would guess again it depends on volume and market conditions but i would think that revenue per contract for the futures category would increase for the remainder of the year thanks yup
thank you and we also have a follow up from michael carrier of the bank of america merrill lynch hey guys it is sameer again alan this is another one for you just on your full year expense guidance you know given the lighter revenues and like the seasonality of the volumes how much flex is there in the expense guide given the deals and the investments that you made
yes there continues to be flex in the expense category and we have a track record of reducing expenses if we see sustained low volume and revenue here at c b o e but we do not see that right now we are coming off a fantastic first quarter april volumes started out kind of slow but it is picking up now and so no were sticking to our guidance and core expenses we expect expenses to pick up a bit later in the year
so no alarm bells going off here as a matter of fact quite the opposite we feel good about the quarter and the year as it looks right now thanks again yup thank you and that does conclude the question and answer session so at this time i would like to return the call to management for any closing comments we want to thank everybody for their time today and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call and we are available for the rest of the day for any follow up questions thank you thank you the conference is now concluded thank you for attending todays presentation you may now disconnect

thank you mister pitcher and thank you all for joining us it was an exceptional start to
the year with record quarterly average daily volume which was up thirteen percent compared with an already
strong first quarter last year we had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products each
up double digits we track customer segment activity closely and in queue we had more than ten
percent growth from asset managers hedge funds corporates proprietary trading firms and retail clients during the quarter
volume from banks was up one percent which is strong relative to their decrease in their overall
trading businesses over each of the last few years more recently april activity has been fairly strong
compared to last year and is up more than twenty percent in total it is encouraging to
see relatively good volumes as april has been our slowest month over the last two years open
interest remains elevated and is up significantly since the beginning of the year this morning i will
start with our secular drivers and then i will shift to a few product highlights we have
consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment we are very pleased with
the tremendous results from outside of the us during the first quarter we had record quarterly non
us volume by far as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the
us since we started tracking the information with more than twenty five percent in first quarter compared
to twenty three percent in the first quarter of last year in europe we had a very
strong first quarter activity with volume increasing twenty eight percent form two point three million contracts per
day last year to more than two point nine million per day this year the increase was
led by equities which jumped seventy percent and energy was up almost fifty percent in asia energy
was up seventy five percent and equities grew by about seventy percent with metals rising more than
thirty percent focusing on asia for a moment we have been discussing the opportunity to expand our
user base to include chinese firms and entities for many years our focus started primarily with intermediaries
and we are now engaging directly with asset managers hedge funds and other entities there we generally
look at our trading data in terms of what we see through mainland china hong kong and
taiwan in queue we reached approximately two hundred thousand contracts per day combined which is up from
one hundred thousand contracts per day in queue of two thousand and fourteen and one hundred and
twenty five thousand contracts last year our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise where
we have seen mainland china average daily volume increase from less than ten thousand contracts in the
middle of last year to more than thirty thousand contracts in queue a highlight from hong kong
activity is in our equity business with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost twenty
five thousand contracts per day in queue the surge in volume is great to see and we
are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients based on the challenges in
china over the last year we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated
markets and benefitting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock speaking of that in addition
to the country of origin information we share with you we also track electronic volume throughout the
twenty four hour trading day in queue volume during asian hours grew by almost thirty percent while
activity during european hours rose sixty percent liquidity begets liquidity and we are displaying deeper electronic markets
in both futures and more recently options around the clock turing to our efforts in options we
remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges with queue options volume hitting a record three
point five million contracts per day which is up twenty two percent with electronic options average daily
volume rising twenty six percent to a record one point eight million contracts the continued electron of
our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our options markets with our european
options volume up thirty six percent and asian options volume up twenty five percent in queue our
continued investment in systems enhancement new products and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our
options products from end users with volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up thirty four percent
and up twenty nine percent respectively a couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products
starting with interest rates volume rose nine percent to more than eight million contracts a day and
revenue increased by fourteen percent with europe leading the way we hit record levels of open interest
in queue in our rates business driven by europe options and treasury futures which hit all time
highs we also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever and reached a
record percentage of the options trading on globe in march with seventy one percent electronic in treasuries
and twenty five percent electronic in europe so far in april the electronic percentage in europe options
has grown to twenty seven percent on the product development front we mentioned our launch of the
ultra ten year contract on our last earnings call this product has continued to gain momentum and
has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new product
in addition we are pleased that we cleared our first options trade earlier this month and we
think this is yet another example of innovating and the interest of market with a customer led
solution we held a options customer webinar that attracted over five hundred participants with significant follow up
discussions and we had a number of productive client events related to the product our dollar rate
swaps market share reached the highest level in march that we have seen over the last six
months and we had a fifteen percent pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus queue last
year lastly we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential
repo clearing offering as that develops over the next quarters we will share additional information turing to
equities we are pleased with the start of the year with queue volume up twenty eight percent
and april up more than thirty percent we have had solid activity in equity options which grew
twenty percent during the quarter in queue our sand five hundred options market share versus cboe expanded
to twenty nine point four percent from twenty seven point eight percent last year open interest in
equity options rose thirteen percent compared to the prior year and our new bee order type continues
to perform well and traded twenty thousand contracts for the first time on march thirty first moving on
to our commodities portfolio these business lines overall were up thirteen percent energy has been particularly strong
with record queue average daily volume of two point five million contracts and april has continued to
be robust with volumes up almost forty percent tea futures had a record quarter averaging about one
point two million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level i
mentioned the options earlier and within energy we had record tea options volume over two hundred thousand
contracts per day and more than one hundred and forty five thousand contracts per day on globe
our natural gas options were up thirty eight percent during the quarter and we had a record
percentage of volume traded electronically there additionally we set a record number of large open interest holders
in our energy futures in queue our metals business was also a standout in the first quarter
with volumes up twenty three percent our precious metals average daily volume was up twenty six percent
led by options which rose thirty six percent in queue as many of you know we have
made significant inroads into base and ferrous metals businesses and we continue to expand our presence in
these key growth areas our copper business is up eleven percent and we hit a new open
interest record during queue we continue to outperform our primary competitor in this market where we have
posted faster growth in copper in each of the last five quarters in aluminum we continue to
expand our suite of aluminum offerings achieving record volumes and increasing our open interest five fold in
the last twelve months and in iron ore leveraging our customer value proposition of global electronic trading
of futures and options and customer anonymity we have had growing open interest and a record trading
day of almost thirteen thousand contracts we have now achieved iron ore market share of ten percent
in queue up from just three percent in two thousand and fifteen as we continue to successfully
expand and diversify our global suite of metals products finally agricultural products have been particularly strong in
april and are tracking toward a monthly average daily volume record for the month after a slow
start to there trading has taken off based on production uncertainty in south america where wet conditions
in argentina and dry conditions in brazil are causing concerns we had two consecutive record trading days
last week in the overall complex with almost three million contracts including record soybean product volume above
one point five million contracts on one of those days electronic ag options are surging up from
near one hundred and thirty thousand in april last year to more than two hundred and fifty
thousand daily so far this april importantly open interest in soybean and corn futures are up sixteen
percent and eight percent respectively from last year finally last week we reached an all time high
in a large open interest holders in agricultural products in summary we continue to work with our
customers on bringing innovative risk management solutions through the market place and our product diversity is unparalleled
john will touch on our progress to continue to streamline our infrastructure costs to reallocate our expenses
to growth initiatives and to further innovate in our businesses with that i am going to turn the
call over to john to discuss the financials thank you
thank you gill and good morning everyone our team has been intensely focused on three things driving
global revenue growth operating our business as efficiently as we can and returning excess capital to our
shareholders in a consistent way as gill mentioned we had a tremendous start to the year with
strong and balanced revenue growth total revenue was up eleven percent compared to a very strong quarter
last year while total adjusted expense rose just three percent our adjusted operating margin expanded to sixty
five percent and adjusted eps of one point fifteen was up seventeen percent our rate per contract
for the first quarter was seven hundred and fifty six cents down four percent from seven hundred
and eighty nine cents in queue as our overall adv rose twenty nine percent sequentially the biggest
impacts were members versus non member mix and volume discount tiers this quarter due to the large
increase in activity compared to the fourth quarter our members volume grew thirty percent and non members
jumped twenty three percent in addition we had higher volume discounts in queue relative to queue as
a result of significant growth in certain products market data revenue was up four point five percent
compared to queue last year and in line with our guidance we continue to monitor this line
carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full
priced offering and we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions adjusted operating
expenses for the quarter totaled three hundred and twenty seven million up three percent driven primarily by
an eight million dollars increase in licensing and other fee agreements excluding license fees our total expense
year over year was approximately flat and as a reminder our annual guidance was a one percent
increase on that basis we ended the quarter with approximately two thousand six hundred employees with the
majority of the hiring done in india and belfast which is part of our plan to reduce
technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower cost locations and reducing contractors our compensation
ratio for queue came in at fourteen point one percent compared to sixteen point one percent for
the full year of two thousand fifteen looking at the non operating income and expense line our ownership in
the sand dow jones joint venture drove more than twenty six million dollars in net earnings from
unconsolidated subsidiaries which was up thirteen percent from the prior year we are pleased with the investment
we made in the index business while also assuring we continue to offer the worlds leading index
futures products on cme now turning to investment income we had a meaningful increase in investment income
driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions
the rise in short term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in
investment income of seventeen million dollars during queue we had returned approximately ten million dollars of that to
clearing firms which is displayed on the income statement under other non operating expense this amount is
anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow we recently received approval to establish an account directly
at the fed at this point the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held
in cash we are currently in the process of operation the accounts with the fed when effective
we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do
today cash held in segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and the
us treasury securities as they are now we expect that the house accounts will be operational in
the next month or so as in the past we plan to continue to pass through the
majority of the earnings back to the clearing members turning to taxes for the quarter we ended
at thirty six point three percent slightly below our guidance and now to the balance sheet during
queue we paid almost one point two billion dollars in dividends to shareholders including our variable dividend
and the first regular dividend at the end of the first quarter we had one point thirty
three billion dollars in cash restricted cash and marketable securities we added one hundred and thirty million
dollars during the quarter driven by the sale leaseback transaction of our data center with cyrus one
during the first quarter capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were sixteen million as we continue
to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service which is included in expense we continue our
intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years and
more recently our data center we are taking an asset light approach which will allow us to
focus on running our core business in two thousand and fifteen we delayed the management structure closed
futures pits reduced marketing costs and focused on data center consolidation so far this year we have
completed the sale of our data center sublet excess office space in chicago announced the closure of
our trading floors in new york at year end and have begun to offshore some positions reducing
compensation and consulting costs with the sale and leaseback of our data center we will continue to
operate our trading and clearing functions as well as our co location business and we will continue
to receive the corresponding co location revenue from an earnings perspective this transaction is approximately neutral in
terms of expenses we will see a net reduction in total quarterly expense of about one million
dollars primarily in depreciation and we expect a corresponding increase under interest expense turning to the new
york floor we will save approximately five million dollars of expense annually beginning in two thousand and
seventeen and possibly another three million dollars per year if we can successfully sublease the space in
summary i'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business as you know
operating leverage in our business is significant and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental
revenue of approximately ninety percent we have outlined many positives going forward including building liquidity around the
clock and from around the world innovating new products getting access to the fed accounts which should
benefit both our intermediaries and our shareholders and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy with that
we'd like to open up the call for your questions given the number of analysts who cover
us we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone please
feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions thank you
thanks good morning
good morning dan
since your last call there's been a lot of headlines around manda your potential manda in your
industry and i guess gill if you could update us on your thoughts around your views around
manda like both large scale as well as strategic and then john also maybe talk about the
financial aspects as you guys think about returning thresholds around potential acquisitions
yeah dan i think the story is consistent in what we have spoken to you about in
the past we will continue our focus on our globalization on the options growth and i talked
a little bit about a short while ago and as well as what we are now calling
capital efficiencies which is a combination of a bunch of things which is essentially the whether we
are talking about clearing a tea trade the future of the market place with brand brand new
clients are the cross margin in the compression and services that we offer and with that focus
that we have we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to any kind of opportunities that we
might see that makes sense for both ourselves our shareholders as well as our clients
hi dan this is john jumping in we look at both organic and inorganic growth opportunities all
the time and really it's about creating shareholder value in the best way possible so we look
at acquisitions in particular we look at it from obviously multiple valuation metrics as accretive over time
to earnings does it create a value by looking at cash flow models so we look at
kind of return thresholds we usually use about nine percent to ten percent is kind of the
threshold that we look at but i think for us it's are we creating shareholder value how
is the best way to get from a strategic perspective to where we want to be is
it growing the business organically investing the business organically or is it purchasing good services or another
company from somebody else so that's what we look at
great thank you
thanks dan
and our next question comes from richard repeat with sandler kneel please go ahead your line is
open
yeah good morning guys
hey
so my question good morning gill good morning john my question is on expenses you're running significantly
below the full year guidance like we can come out with one point fifteen and the guidance
i believe is one point eighteen point and this is post this was a high revenue quarter
and you get high payroll taxes the other thing that go along with that you're running significantly
below on capex as well the full year run rate so i'm just trying to see what
the expense guys whether it's maintained and if it is maintained what could we be spend the
stuff on in the back three quarters
sure thanks rich our expense control and running our business as efficiently as possible is a very
big focus of the entire management team and it's really become part of our dna when we
look at the expenses the first quarter tends to be a slower quarter in terms of expenses
as we build up and projects get launched in the second and third quarters but if you
look at slide fourteen you can see the results of our focus on expenses you can see
that over time we've had expanding operating margins and we've got incremental margins last year of one
hundred and twelve percent and ninety percent incremental margins this quarter and operating margins around sixty five
percent so it's been a large focus of ours in terms of the guidance we are we
have guided to a very modest one percent increase in expenses ex license fees that's and we're
not adjusting guidance at this time but we are intensely focused on the business and running the
business as efficiently as efficiently as possible and what this does is this allows us to free
up cost for growth initiatives and some of the growth initiatives gill outlined in his prepared remarks
and for example options is something that we'll be launching that maybe derek or sean can comment
on as an example of what we're working on
yeah sure in terms of our tea clearing which gill talked about in terms of offering capital
and margin efficiencies to the market place we actually we recently launched a beer interest rate swap
clearing which is a unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor mexican peso we launched a
little over a year ago is doing extremely well we did our first options trade very recently
and we're very excited about how that will develop over the coming two quarters and in addition
to that we're working very closely with the market place on repo clearing as gill mentioned in
his remarks so we're talking to and working closely with the same set of folks that we
worked with in order to launch our successful interest rate swap clearing initiative and we're looking at
replicating that with solving lot of the market places issues in the repo in particular in the
treasury repo market similarly
so rich i mean we are focused on expense management we are focused on reducing infrastructure cost
and freeing up those costs invest in new initiatives like sean just mentioned
and we'll take our next question from ken worthington with organ please go ahead your line is
open
hi good morning
good morning ken
in terms of your use of the fed for house positions how money can get placed with
the fed under kind of the existing structure that you just got set up with the approval
and to what extent can you move beyond this for just house positions in the future and
then you mentioned the passing of the majority income back to clients to what extend this just
gives cme an opportunity to keep more as well and i'm sure you won't answer but i'll
ask it anyway if so how much
thanks ken we've been very focused on driving our investment income line in fact if you take
a look since two thousand and twelve in the first quarter of two thousand and twelve we
actually had an eighteen million dollars expense in non operating income and now we've driven that to
a five million dollars income on that line so overall when you look at how the earnings
that we got from managing collateral we earned approximately seven million dollars this quarter through investing that
collateral which is about double last quarter it was driven primarily by the increase in interest rates
access to the fed accounts will be for house positions held in cash to the extent that
that cash balance increase with an opportunity for us to earn more and we'll be able to
provide more color on how much is about that impact next quarter when the fed accounts become
operational but to give you an idea about twenty percent of our one hundred and thirty eight
billion dollars in collateral is house account related maybe kim could comment on the fed account
the cash component of the twenty percent is lower and that's the part that we can i
think kim it's three billion
currently the cash balances on the house positions is three billion that's not a number that we
control it's a number that the clearing members control with the decisions that they make about what
they post for margin but obviously the return that they get and the funds that they post
with us is part of that decision
and it's a higher return for our client base one of the exciting things of having this
fed account for us
and then you asked about the customer accounts those are authorized our vat process is underway between
the regulators that's not something that we can really comment on the timing up but we know
that it is still being worked on
and our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead your line
is open
hey good morning this is actually sameer murky on for mike carrier thanks for taking my question
good morning
good morning
good morning i'm going to just leverage off of dans question a bit can you provide an
update on your thoughts into the level of your stake in man given their current manda that
they are involved in and any comments on the possible interest in the indian commodity exchange thanks
sure this is john man is one of our most important international strategic relationships regardless of any
ownership stakes we continue to hold about four percent stake in man the value of which has
increased over one hundred and fifty million dollars since the end of two thousand and fifteen and
we'll continue to work with them as we have historically in terms of the india exchange we're
not going to comment on any of the
rumors
rumors or our manda activity there
ok thanks for taking my question
thanks
and our next question comes from alex cram with you please go ahead your line is open
yeah hey good morning
good morning alex
good morning wanted to just touch on the energy business for a second here clearly one of
the more impressive areas in terms of growth but one of the things that always span or
that has been spanning out is that you are outperforming at least in terms of adv your
primary competitor so would love you to talk a little bit about what's going on there and
obviously you all have different product mix so maybe if you can drill a little bit deeper
not just about brands but also about w t i natural gas gas oil other areas where you are
competing more or less directly where you're winning and why you're winning if you're winning thanks
yeah derek here i want to say we're absolutely pleased but not fully satisfied with the growth
that we continue to impact here on the energies business i mean we have not only have
we grown sort of record levels in queue we've increased our large open interest orders and it's
been pretty strong for us we talked last quarter about the benefits of the overall broad market
adoption increasingly towards tea with the result of the lifting of the export ban in the us
and that's actually significantly increased participation in our markets on the futures as well as the options
side but in terms of where we're going outside of that options it has been a significant
area of growth for us inside the energies business and i'd actually also direct you to some
of the comments that gill made in his prepared remarks around where and how we're globalizing our
footprint right now if you look at where the growth of our business is coming from our
emea business for energy business up about forty percent that's outperforming the business as a whole what's
really exciting is the investments that we've made in boots on the ground sales campaigns and product
sales in asia for us is bearing significant fruit our asian energy business is up eighty two
percent year on year and that is significant growth in almost every major trading center i was
in shanghai and singapore last week meeting with a lot of our clients and we continue to
be able to attract them with our functionality both on the futures as well as the options
side and the broad base of participation in our markets so we tell a lot of the
tea story there is a nat gas story there is a gasoline story we set an all
time record in our gasoline futures as well so it's broad based growth it's global growth and
it's across our asset class in the presence of building oi and large open interest holders
i would just add to that specifically on the international side within asia for example we're seeing
growth coming from each of our client segments in the energy quadrant props are up thirty one
percent banks interestingly enough were up one hundred and four percent hedge funds ninety six percent corporate
firms coming in eighty eight percent retail eighty five percent we're seeing similar activities coming out of
europe so for example on the hedge fund and in the asset management community twenty six percent
growth specifically in the energy quadrant so it goes to our sales penetration and efforts in that
regard in terms of how we're targeting our focus and our campaigns in these areas
our next question comes from alex blow with goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open
thanks hi guys good morning just a quick follow up on market data i dont think it
was asked yet but the four percent to five percent guidance for the year that you guys
provided on the last earnings call does that still hold or just kind of given some of
the headwinds that you highlighted on the headcount reductions should we think about a slower number a
lower number for the year
thanks alex when we provided guidance last year we provided a range because it's very difficult to
predict we had given guidance at four percent to five percent growth rates we came in this
quarter up four point five percent from queue last year which is in line with our guidance
we are seeing pressure as customers move to our full priced offering as well as the decline
in screen counts as banks lay off staff as you've probably heard from the bank's earnings calls
so we're very focused and working hard on our data business but we're seeing some headwinds as
you indicated
and we'll go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open
hi good morning folks just to pile on the asia question thanks for all the disclosure on
that that was a good discussion you just had about some of the progress there but i
guess if you can think about or try to highlight how big you think this market can
eventually be for cme in terms of penetration rates obviously the growth recently has been especially strong
but do you see this as just from an say adv perspective being able to become as
large as europe lets say in the next two or three years can you talk about some
of that penetration opportunity and then also related to john i think you cited more projects in
growth initiative spend later in the year is part of that included in that spending plan
sure brian this is gill i'm going to start and i'm going to ask brian to basically
expand more as to where he's seen growth specifically if you look at the product opportunity set
if you look at the opportunity in terms of the products that we have across all the
asset classes that we have we have highly relevant products for all of our clients in all
places around the world within asia specifically we've been focused over the last few years on china
but what we've not talked about is the sales effort that brian will go a little bit
into other parts of asia which i would say have more developed in terms of the education
side of things korea comes to mind china we have given you some numbers this quarter specific
to china these are based on china but they might be trading they probably will be trading
from outside of china as china continues to expand its policies for access you would see that
number grow the timing behind that remains to be seen but as we sit here now china
is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct accounts such as the hedge
funds the prop shops and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of china and that's the
flow that we're seeing india is an uncapped opportunity at this time there are very significant changes
afoot in india that will also lend themselves and translate into opportunities for us so with that
broad view about china and i am only talking about areas in which you will see the
highest impact i am going to turn it over to brian to talk about some of the
volume flows that we are seeing that are driving the high rate of growth there
with the respect to the efforts in greater china and hong kong and specifically hong kong we are seeing
revenues that are up about fifty one percent fifty six percent growth in our volume that's been
driven by energy equities as well as some of our interest rate products within the segments the
growth is really coming from crops a growing number of private hedge funds and asset managers have also
evolved we are working very closely with our intermediaries to help bring that business into our markets
we are seeing some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state owned enterprises for example
so were permission up until about two years ago thirty one now it's about one hundred and
twelve or in that areas so we are seeing that as additional opportunity sovereign wealth funds and
asset managers are increasingly growing their business with us and again we are focusing in that area
and really building on opportunities to work with corporates particularly insurance companies we see more chinese banks
that are enquiring about trading our products and also looking to build their efforts enquiring about o t c
clearing with us which is a very good sign within taiwan year to date volume and revenue
was up about forty percent and thirty six percent respectively the main drivers in those areas were
equities fx energy and interest rates the main participants are banks asset managers and again we are
seeing good opportunities with insurance companies there has been some progress within taiwan in terms of allowing
securities firms to offer global futures that we are working very closely with our intermediaries to bring
that business into our group within japan we have seen a consistent growth of about seven percent
revenues are up about thirty two percent you got to keep in mind japan is the second
biggest holder of us debt so there is great opportunities there main drivers have been from banks
and we are seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers gill alluded to korea we continue
to see very nice growth coming out of korea it was two years ago that there were
no korean f c m s that had an average monthly volume of about one hundred thousand contracts today you know we
are happy to say that we have eight firms that are providing at least one hundred thousand
sites per month which is great progress and the drivers in that area are equities rates foreign
currency and energy singapore is up about eighteen percent coming out of that region we are seeing
some nice growth coming from the banks in particular as well as proprietary firms and corporates and
commercials another area that we are very excited about is australia we really haven't mentioned our volume
this year in australia was up twelve percent and our revenues are up i think approximately fifty
percent if i my memory serves me correctly the top three products are interest rates eggs equities
eggs are up about twenty seven percent foreign currencies are up about thirty nine percent our main
focus in working with australia again is within the asset management community hedge funds and the banks
we will take our next question from chris harris with wells fargo please go ahead your line
is open
thanks hey guys a question on your margins i mean a great margin quarter sixty five percent
i mean i think that's one of the best results you guys have ever had if we
think kind of bigger picture and you guys keep delivering double digit volume growth and ninety percent
incremental margin your margin is going to move up fast in a hurry so just wondering is
there a limit where you guys are really comfortable about taking the margin to before we start
seeing a fairly sizable increase in the expenses or is that really nothing for us to be
focused on at this point in time
thanks this is john yes we are limited by one hundred percent is our limit but in
all seriousness we are we continue to run the business as efficiently as possible you know as you can
see from the amount of volume we have been able to handle without any issues we have
been able to handle that this quarter without any incidents so i think for us we do
have natural increases to our cost and over time and that will be inflationary things salaries wages
and the like but we are we provide a tremendous amount of value to our clients and
so as more liquidity comes into the marketplace there is more trading that occurs which is tremendous
benefit to our business and the amount of volume that we are able to handle we have
been proven out to be able to handle that other things that kind of impact the margin
is also license we pay on equity contracts primarily so there is some share that impacts kind
of our margin level but there is nothing artificial out there that prevents that from going higher
chris this is gill i'd like to just add to what john said john is spot on
with respect to the current operating structure that we have and product as we continue to innovate
across the asset classes but as we roll out new and innovative products or services in response
to what our client needs are and in conjunction with the capital efficiency goal that we have
for our clients the repo clearing service is one such thing and that's a separate infrastructure from
what we currently have john has fine tuned the current infrastructure to hum like youre seeing it
now and within that construct the operating margin can absolutely grow but as we introduced more things
for our client base you may see a slight reduction depending upon the success of the products
and services that we rollout
our next question comes from ken hill with barclays please go ahead your line is open
good morning everyone i just wanted to follow up on the market data specifically those customers who
are rationalizing their behavior and i guess choosing to turn that service off are those guys who
may be didnt need it to begin with and just realized that were paying for it or
did this actually just get to be too high a price for them to pay and i
guess if it is that latter part is there any flexibility within the service to really tailor
market data for what a customer needs over time potentially could you be rolling out new products
that might meet some of these peoples need to have gone away recently
hi this is gill i think as john alluded to in his remark and in response to one
of the questions a large chunk of that is coming from the layout at that we see
the banks are undergoing with respect to pricing pressure being too high if you compare our market
data fees to the exchanges that we compete against you'll see that we are lacking behind them
in terms of price but terminal and price so we dont think that the issue we think
is firms rationalizing their needs all the time bryan you might want to add
no i mean you certainly hit it as the full fair came into play we did expect
that there might be some drop off from individuals that may be using a particular screen and
not really utilize for trading quite frankly but observing the markets those level of users have been
pretty small i mean the biggest impact as gill had referenced is the rationalization that we're seeing
from firms that have been consolidating their operations and making those decisions with the respect of reduction
in staffing and layoffs
our next question comes from kyle voigt with k b w please go ahead your line is open
hi thanks for taking my question so i was just wondering if you could comment on competitor energy
platform n f x it looks like they will begin charging for some fee for trading with the phase
in period starting next month do you believe the momentum that they have had in building open
interest to market share is sustainable after they begin to charge for trading are you hearing any
feedback or pressure from your clients regarding them being unhappy with trading fees or other services thanks
hey this is derek thanks for your question now i think you see when we look at
the status of where our natural gas business is if you look at the six months prior
to fx launches or we were averaging in natural gas options where they're making the hard push
right now that seventy thousand contract today if you look at the last six months our adv
is close to one hundred thousand contracts so we've grown that business forty percent over the course
of time that n f x has come into the market and to the extent that we've got the
fastest growing part of the natural gas options business for us is electronic nature of that business
a record twenty five percent of our natural business is trading electronically they're driving that forty percent
growth if you look at what n f x is putting up it's a block business it's not electronic
and is only on the financially settled side so given the fact that we've added thirty thousand
contracts adv since pre launch of n f x the post launch and they are doing twelve thousand to
fifteen thousand we're not seeing any real feedback from customers asking us to do anything different other than
continue to scale infrastructure electronically and grow the business
our next question comes from rob root with clsa please go ahead your line is open
good morning just one more follow up on the market data question are you able to size
the bank industry in terms of the overall screen count does it look similar to the contribution
to trading volumes and then separately does opening an account at the fed give you any sort
of long term growth opportunities aside from just picking up the extra spread that that provides thanks
its bryan on the market data side yes we are able to size across the user base
the profile of user and while we saw a down trend this past quarter with specifically within
the bank sector i cant comment whether or not were going to see it continue trend going
in that direction what i can say is that we are closely monitoring our performance and have
every expectation to continue making a good progress we have with market data
the opening of the fed account also give both our customers as well as us additional opportunity
on the fed counts in particular for our customers it does allow us to offer them a
significantly increased return on their cash so it should make us a more valuable proposition for them
and your next question comes from richard repeat with sandler kneel please go ahead your line is
open
yeah thanks for the follow up gill on the presentation you talked about these and this is
page sixteen the secular drivers of growth and it being the potential for more futures and options
volumes due to capital efficiencies and i was wondering can you give us an update on cross
margin i figure it was three billion dollars or so and i guess what your expectations here
and not having the dealer volume in over the counter interest rate swaps what do you think
about the potential there of cross margin
i will start and ask kim to add here the capital efficiency title has at least two
or three things beneath that that might be helpful for your think about i would say in
terms of the opportunities being efficient for client base future at the top of that list so
developing products in house that our customers can use on the more capital efficient basis is one
of the things that we have been doing and we will continue to actually do if you
look at the compressions services that we implemented not too long ago up to this point in
time we've had twenty one trillion dollars in notional value that have been compressed over time and
then if you look at the performance of the o t c market itself it has taken an uptick
from the fourth quarter of last year now this value proposition this group of value propositions that
i just described no one else can provide that the compression in conjunction with the cross margin
and in conjunction with the future are opportunity so i think from that perspective we are quite
excited as the interest rate environment continues to shift
and then i would just add i think this is not something that is exclusive to c m e
but c m e is working with the industry to try and get better recognition for customer margin in
the treatment of capital at the bank level that will be a very significant element in reducing
the cost of doing business
and our next question comes from alex cram with u b s please go ahead your line is open
hey hello again for a follow up i guess want to go to your equities business for
a minute on that slide that you had on equities i think it is page ten you
mentioned that on the s and p five hundred options i guess options on futures you now have your
market share increased relative to cboe i dont think you have talked about that business on a
competitive basis in the past or in those terms so just wondering if this is an active
focus of yours to kind of look at that market and compete more aggressively and maybe quote
away the user base from the securities based options to the futures market so any color there
will be interesting thanks
so we are always focused on the clients and the value that we add to clients and
therefore we are also always focused on market share so in each and every one of our
businesses we are continuously focused on our direct competitors but also substitute products and making sure that
we add the most value so while we may not have talked about this as actively before
this is certainly something that we look at very closely in particular if you look at that
business we are very focused on the ability to cross margin obviously the underlying futures against the
options as most efficient platform possible we are continuously focused on tca or total cost analysis weve
talked about this across each of our different business lines if you recall at the beginning of
last year greenwich associates did a big study that looked at our interest rate futures as always
being the lowest cost relative to the interest rate swaps industry in terms of representing risk similarly
we have come out last year with something called the big picture and then we did an
update this year again with the big picture but we are showing that as an example our
equity futures far more efficient for investors for giving exposure to the equity market than e t f s so
we are continuing to look at the substitute products both from a customer client value proposition also
also from a market share perspective
and our next question comes from patrick shout with raymond james please go ahead your line is
open
so speaking of portfolio margin wondering if you can comment on the lse deutsche boar planned merger
and whether some of the capital efficiencies that they are proposing would impact you guys competitively i
think specifically with regard to your rate clearing business your rate swap clearing business
patrick this is gill i think on the first part of your question you should ask them
willing to talk about the opportunities on the second part of the question i had to go
back to what sean had said before the whole focus on the competitive dynamics of what we
all do to here and so we believe and as i said we are the best value
proposition for our client base and we intend to grow upon upon that
and we have no further questions at this time id like to turn the program back to
management for closing remarks
thank you so much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you
in the next quarter bye bye
and that does conclude todays program you may disconnect at this time thank you and have a
great day

certain non gaap measures including adjusted income operating margin expenses eps debt to ebitda and tax rate

results a reconciliation to the equivalent gaap terms and an explanation of why we deem this information
to be meaningful as well as how management uses these measures when used on this call

pro forma two thousand and fifteen results with us on the call are jeff 's prick her chairman and ceo
scott hill chief financial officer and chuck vice president and chief operating officer ill now turn the call over to scott
thank you kelly good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our today ill begin
on slide four and cover our results through the first nine months of two thousand sixteen consolidated net revenues
grew four percent to three point four billion dollars with trading and clearing revenues up two percent and
data and listings revenues up six percent versus the prior year in addition operating margins expanded four
points to fifty seven percent and expected two thousand and sixteen synergies have increased over fifty percent
to one hundred and fifteen million dollars all of these factors enabled adjusted earnings to grow ten percent
versus two thousand and fifteen pro forma results this strong financial performance also generated record operating cash
flow of one point five billion dollars through september this strong cash generation enabled us to reduce
our leverage grow our dividend and in october to restart our share repurchase program we are executing
a well designed strategic plan are efficiently integrating our acquired businesses and are delivering top and bottom
line growth strong cash generation and improving roic and capital return all less than a year after
closing our acquisition of interactive data now lets turn to slide five where ill walk you through
our results for the third quarter revenues in the quarter were up slightly over the prior year
adjusted operating expenses declined three percent year over year and margins expanded to fifty five percent
adjusted operating income increased four percent year to year and adjusted earnings per share were three dollars and twenty one cents
you'll see that our third quarter tax rate was roughly thirty percent
we currently expect a similar rate for the fourth quarter moving next to slide six ill provide some
additional details about our third quarter revenues while our total revenues were roughly flat our data and
listings segment revenue grew five percent year over year and represented fifty five percent of our consolidated
revenue for the quarter within the data and listings segment our exchange data was up seventeen percent
year over year pricing and analytics revenue would have grown three percent excluding the weakness in the
pound and the impact of a large customer true up that occurred in the prior third quarter
our data revenues remain on track to grow between six percent and seven percent for the full
year two thousand and sixteen and the outlook is favorable for at least a similar level of
growth in two thousand seventeen our trading and clearing revenues declined four percent versus the prior year as lower
volatility and the precipitous fall in the pound created a significant headwind within the trading and clearing
segment though commodities revenue grew two percent including energy revenues which grew four percent year to year
oil and natural gas were both strong contributors and continued to grow in october despite continued growth
in our o t c clearing business financials revenues declined fourteen percent including interest rate revenues which were down
fifteen percent interest rate futures volume grew thirteen percent in the quarter but revenues were significantly impacted
by the weaker pound we expect to publish our october volumes on wednesday and despite continued currency
impacts and lower volatility in equity we preliminarily expect to report solid results including oil volumes up
around ten percent and interest rate volumes growing more than fifty percent versus the prior year the
increased volumes stable to improving open interest levels and continued growth in exchange data customers
in the markets we operate remains high now lets flip to slide seven where ill discuss our
expense performance and provide updated guidance third quarter adjusted operating expenses declined three percent year over year
to four hundred and eighty four million and pro forma operating margin expanded by two points
please also note on the right side of the slide that margins expanded in both our business
segments as we continue to integrate our acquisitions and streamline our operations we are realizing interactive data
synergies on an accelerated basis we now expect to achieve around one hundred and fifteen million dollars
in synergies for two thousand sixteen increased synergies and the weaker pound enabled us to maintain our full year
adjusted expense guidance despite the addition of expenses related to the securities evaluations and credit market analysis
for the fourth quarter we expect adjusted expenses in the range of five hundred to five hundred five million dollars
addition of these recently acquired businesses our final full year two thousand and sixteen expense guidance reflects
a reduction of nearly three percent versus two thousand and fifteen and a seventy five million dollar
improvement from our guidance at the beginning of the year this improvement benefited from roughly thirty five
million dollars largely related to the impact of the lower pound but more importantly reflects an additional
forty million dollars in synergies realized during two thousand sixteen i'll conclude my prepared remarks on slide eight with
a review of our cash generation de leveraging and capital returns we generated record operating cash flows of
one point five billion dollars in the first nine months of the year and deployed that cash
to invest around two hundred and fifty million dollars in capex to reduce our debt by one
billion dollars and to return over three hundred million dollars to shareholders through dividends we reduced
our leverage from two point eight times at the end of two thousand and fifteen to two point
three times at the end of september importantly we remain on track to reduce leverage below two
times during two thousand and seventeen which allowed us to restart our share repurchase program in october
and will support our objective to grow our dividend as we grow we remain confident that our
solid cash generation will continue to support our strong investment grade rating enable additional strategic investment and
allow us to increase our capital returns to shareholders our results for the first nine months of
this year reflect our commitment to execution innovation and value creation for our shareholders we deliver on
this commitment by expanding our footprint to meet the ever changing needs of our customers in a
very dynamic time in our industry ill be happy to take your questions during q and a but for
now i'll turn the call over to jeff
thank you scott and good morning to everyone on the call this morning ill take a few
minutes to update you on key areas of investor interest and then we'll conduct the question and answer session
i'll start with the topic of consistent long term growth on slide nine our ten
fold revenue growth over the last decade including revenue that doubled and earnings that have tripled in
the last three years is driven by expanding the range of ways we serve our customers around
the world this growth continues with total futures volume up twenty percent in the month of october
alongside an expanding data business that is meeting the secular demand for more information as a start
up company we gained a foothold by electron ifying trade execution this market transparency and product standardization then
drove demand for clearing to serve the growing need for risk management and today as capital and
operational efficiencies become paramount our customers require more of our proprietary information to support risk management trading
and investment management our services continue to evolve with changes in the market which creates shareholder value
by anticipating and capitalizing on change as the most global exchange operator with over forty percent of
our total revenues derived outside the us were moving quickly to leverage our scalable technology infrastructure across
north america europe and asia in an ever fragmenting marketplace we're providing the consistent tools technology

to any one cyclical trend or geography we've led our space in growth on virtually every metric
over the last decade on slide ten i'll highlight the strategy behind our balanced approach driven by
a virtuous cycle across our global markets clearing houses data and listings transaction based revenue can be
cyclical but market participants always require information to make good risk management decisions this is why we're
establishing a new approach for market data for our customers who've told us that theyre looking for
flexible and efficient ways to receive and respond to information our investments in technology that help scale
our infrastructure are allowing us to serve customers on an increasingly integrated platform following the financial crisis
many new opportunities to provide valuable services have emerged whether its increased compliance the move to independent
pricing demand for information security algorithmic trading or the trend toward passive investing each of these drives
increasing demand for data these dynamics have only begun to play out an example is last month's
sec ruling on liquidity which will require the measuring and reporting of liquidity risk by certain e t f's
and mutual funds our liquidity indicators product is developed specifically to meet the reporting requirements in the
u s and europe particularly as both the sec and mi f id rules come into effect to further build
on our capabilities we completed the acquisition of s and p's security evaluations and credit market analysis
these assets add to our portfolio of unique information that spans virtually all asset classes and provides
workflow support for the front middle and back offices and having increased our capabilities for expanded bond
price evaluations we're developing new types of fixed income indices for institutional investors as a complement to
our treasury indices we'll have more details on this in the coming weeks we're rapidly integrating the
former interactive data super derivatives n y s e index operations and ices exchange data to form the comprehensive global ice

and our net leverage ratio decreased as our trailing e b i t d a grew were off to a good start for the year lets now discuss the d o l fiduciary rule and what it means for us in our plan as a reminder the rule is focused on brokerage retirement assets and accounts which will soon be serviced under a fiduciary standard those accounts make up
thirty percent of our assets the rules are over a thousand pages long so it will take time for us and the industry to work through it that said we spend a lot of time preparing over the past year which helps our efforts our initial view is that d o l made a number of changes that reflect industry feedback we feel the final rule and the best interest contract or b i c our improvements over the april two thousand and fifteen r e proposal in several ways
including a longer implementation period grandfathered in existing assets permitting all products to be sold under the b i c negative consent for existing accounts and streamlined disclosures at the point of sale with these improvements we are now working to implement the d o l rule as for d o l implications for our business let me start
by discussing upfront implementation cost we expect that several of the changes in the b i c will make the work more manageable additionally over the past few years weve invested significantly in our compliance organization and technology providing a strong foundation to build on at the same time i want to note that the two implementation dates in april two thousand and seventeen and january two thousand and eighteen we
expect to incur implementation cost in two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and seventeen given all this and keeping in mind that this is based on our initial read of the rule we are comfortable with the implementation cost that weve included in our two thousand and sixteen core g and a outlook we also need to do more work to better understand the ongoing financial impact this is true both for the annual cost to comply
and the gross profit implications we look forward to sharing updates as we make progress now i will discuss some business changes we are making which will help with the d o l rule transition and further strengthen our value proposition for advisors and their clients one of the areas that we are most excited about is making our centrally managed platforms more accessible at lower cost as weve discussed before we believe they are a win win for our advisors their clients and l p l advisors can dedicate
dedicate more time to end person advice with existing and new clients by handing over portfolio allocation to l p l and providing additional services for those accounts l p l can generate better economics than the rest of our advisory assets today more than ten percent of our advisory assets are on centrally managed platforms most of these assets are in model wealth portfolios or m w p growth
was strong on m w p for several years but it plateaued in two thousand and fourteen last summer we announced that we would lower some m w p fees in january two thousand and sixteen and we recently announced our plans to further lower fees in january two thousand and seventeen and later this year we plan to lower account minimums on optimum market
portfolios to ten thousand dollars we have heard many positive responses from advisors and we think these changes could help drive growth we will keep you updated on our progress another area were excited about is our robo advice solution in development with blackrock solutions future advisor which will be integrated with l p l s technology our offering is intended to be a great way for our advisors to expand their reach into new markets
such as millennial s and small advisory accounts and also to improve productivity with existing clients our retail client receives advice from an l p l advisor about their goals and plans and they can choose to use the web portal to invest in portfolios developed by l p l s research team and custody in l p l this offering aims to lower cost for investors and helps advisors
advisors to spend more time providing financial advice to their clients as part of our work on the d o l rule we are planning to introduce the mutual fund only brokerage account as background some l p l advisors have placed brokerage mutual fund investments directly with sponsors rather than with l p l to lower some investor cost our new mutual fund only brokerage accounts will have no maintenance fee and all new mutual fund assets will be custody d with l p l we believe this will
lower cost for investors while also lowering sponsor cost and complexity by outsourcing custody to l p l we expect it will be more operationally efficient and profitable for us to have these mutual fund assets in our custody in closing we had a good start to the year and a very challenging first quarter environment we plan to continue to manage our finances conservatively while investing for growth and continuing to improve our offering
we now feel well positioned in our industry following the d o l rule announcement and our past year preparation we are working hard to make positive changes to benefit our advisors and their retail clients grow our business and create shareholder value ill now turn the call over to matt thank you mark and its good to speak with everyone on the call today it was quite a start to the year the s and p five hundred index after ending two thousand and fifteen at
twenty forty four dropped down to eighteen twenty nine midway through the first quarter and then ended the quarter up nearly one percent and after decembers increase and the fed funds effective rate for the first time in about a decade the two thousand sixteen outlook went from multiple projected rate hikes to a dialogue around the possibility of negative interest rates in just a matter of weeks
and as we sit here today the possibility of two thousand and sixteen rate hikes are again part of the dialogue so what is clear is the macro environment is quite volatile and we will keep this top of mind as we manage our expenses and capital going forward despite the challenging environment we are pleased with the performance of our diverse gross profit streams combined with disciplined expense management in volatile times like
these growth in cash balances and transaction volume provides a nice offset to pressures on other areas and we delivered quarterly earnings per share of fifty six cents double our fourth quarter e p s and our e b i t d a was also up and our net leverage ratio decreased we feel good about the strong p and l and balance sheet
results to start two thousand and sixteen lets now discuss our q one results in more detail starting with gross profit as you know assets both brokerage and advisory are the key driver of our gross profit our assets finished q one at four hundred and seventy nine billion up point seven percent from the prior quarter its also important to note that much of our gross profit trailing commissions
commissions and sponsor revenues is primarily driven by average assets and while our assets were up at the end of q one markets were down for most of the quarter therefore average q one assets were down sequentially which impacted some of our gross profit results in the quarter gross profit was three hundred and fifty six million dollars in q one up thirty three million dollars or ten percent from q four the largest drivers were higher cash
sweep revenues following the december rate hike and seasonally lower advisor production bonuses turning to commissions there were four hundred and thirty seven million in q one down twenty seven million or six percent sequentially this was driven by declines in both sales and trailing commissions sales commissions were down six percent as some retail investors stayed in cash during the first quarter market
market volatility we also had three fewer trading days in q one than in the prior quarter trailing commissions were down five percent sequentially due to lower average asset levels turning to advisory fees they were three hundred and nineteen million for q one down five million or one percent from q four as a reminder advisory fees are mostly
billed off the prior quarters asset balances and at the end of q four asset balances increased along with the s and p five hundred which drove advisory fee growth however this growth was offset primarily by some assets that converted to our hybrid advisory platform i also want to highlight our advisor production bonus expense which typically grows
through the year as a reminder in two thousand and fifteen our q one production bonus was one point eight percent of g d c and by q four it increased to three point five percent that equated to a twelve million increase from q one to q four and six million of that increase was from q one to q two as we look at two thousand and sixteen in q one we have production bonus of one point seven percent
or thirteen million and we expect to see similar trends this year as we saw in two thousand and fifteen additionally let me note our advisor share based compensation expense which is included non g d c payout and varies based on movements in our share price it was a two point five million expense last quarter but was actually one point four million of income
in q one driven primarily by the decline in our share price next lets talk about asset base fees which include sponsor and cash sweep revenues sponsor revenues were ninety three million in q one down four million from q four sponsor revenues are more correlated to average assets rather than end of period asset balances and q one average assets were down
from q four as i said earlier cash sweep revenues were forty three million in q one up sixteen million from q four driven both by larger balances and higher yields as we discussed last quarter our client cash sweep balances tend to increase when markets are volatile as a result our cash sweep balances ended the quarter at thirty point four billion up
one point four billion from the end of q four as for first quarter yields both our i c a and money market yields increased following the fed rate hike in december our i c a average yield was sixty nine basis points and our money market average yield was twenty nine basis points as we look forward to the rest of two thousand and sixteen changes in our yields
will primarily be a function of fed rates if fed rates stay where they are we would expect money market yields to average in the mid to high twenty basis point range we also expect our i c a yield will decrease as we experience the rest of the twenty two basis point decrease due to the wind down of an anchor bank contract this means we expect our i c a yield to average in the mid to high fifty basis point range in
q two and be in the low fifty basis points range in q three and q four turning now to transaction and fee revenues they were one hundred and three million in q one up six million from q four this was primarily due to increased transaction volume from the volatility in the quarter lets now move onto expenses starting with core g and a we announced last quarter that we have taken some efficiency actions in q four
and had more planned for q one we have now taken more actions in both q one and q two together these efforts reflect our plans to prudently manage our expenses while continuing to make our planned investments in service and technology and implementing the d o l rule in q one core g and a expense was one hundred and seventy five million a decrease of four million from q four
the decrease was primarily driven by our expense management actions in q four items that did not repeat these were partially offset by an increase in employee performance based compensation which was reduced in the prior quarter additionally we had typical compensation related expense increases in q one as we look forward we expect core g and a to increase primarily in the second half
half of the year as we expect to incur d o l implementation cost and while we are still working to assess the final rule we anticipate that we will have d o l implementation cost in both two thousand sixteen and two thousand seventeen with the majority likely being in two thousand sixteen given our strong start to the year on expenses combined with our initial thinking on d o l implementation cost
we feel good about our two thousand sixteen core g and a expense range of seven hundred and fifteen to seven hundred and thirty million as for our promotional expenses they were thirty six million dollars in q one up by one million dollars from q four conference expenses increased by four million sequentially offset by seasonally lower marketing and transition assistance as we think about q two promotional expenses transition assistance depends on our level of recruiting success in a quarter so this
item is more variable in nature but our conference expenses should be relatively similar to q one levels as we also have a large conference in q two moving to regulatory expenses q one totaled one million down seven million from q four lower activity decreased our regulatory expense to four million which was offset by recoveries from prior matters where our cost ended up being three million less than
estimated looking forward these expenses are quite difficult to predict especially on a quarterly basis that said we do not anticipate having additional cost recoveries like those we had during q one in the four million of regulatory expense during the quarter was on the low end of our expectations given this we anticipate the remaining quarters of two thousand and sixteen well have high expenses higher than the one million in q one
however we continue to expect full year two thousand and sixteen regulatory expenses to decline meaningfully from two thousand and fifteen levels depreciation and amortization was nineteen million in q one a four million dollars decrease from the prior quarter this decline was primarily driven by non recurring cost in q four most of which was accelerated depreciation from real estate consolidation as we look
look forward to q two we expect expenses at a relatively similar level to this quarter amortization and purchase intangible was ten million in q one flat from q four this is a noncash expense mostly driven by the intangibles established from our l p l in two thousand and five so this should be relatively flat each quarter
lets turn now to capital management our primary focus right now is maintaining balance sheet strength and while we believe our shares are trading well below their intrinsic value and that share repurchases would provide an attractive return the volatile environment in january and february has made balance sheet strength a higher
priority today therefore we have paused our share repurchases for now and are focused on prudent expense in capital management and implementing the d o l rule once we have more comfort in the macro environment and a better sense of the d o l rule impact we will revisit deploying our excess cash turning now to our leverage ratio at the end of q one our net leverage ratio was three point seven times this is down from
from three point eight times at the end of q four as our trailing twelve months credit agreement e b i t d a grew by eight million from q four to q one as for our credit agreement net debt it is equal to our total debt of two point two billion less cash available for corporate use up to three hundred million
at the end of q one we had five hundred and twenty seven million of cash available for corporate use this left an additional two hundred and twenty seven million of cash available for corporate use that if applied to our debt would reduce our net leverage ratio to three point three times let me also spend a minute commenting on the seasonality of our business and trends going forward strong q one e b i t d a and e p s were encouraging however as i discussed our i c a
yields will likely decline in q two and q three as our anchor bank contract runs off production bonus will likely increase throughout the year regulatory expenses will likely increase from the one million in q one and other seasonal costs vary throughout the year therefore i would just emphasize that with the nature and seasonality of our business q one is typically
one of our higher e p s quarters of the year in closing we are pleased that our business performed well in an extremely challenging environment looking ahead we plan to continue to be disciplined in managing our expenses and focused on keeping our balance sheet strong we believe this approach is appropriate given the volatility in the markets as we assess
the potential impact of the d o l rule and well stay flexible as the environment changes always keeping our focus on maximizing shareholder value with that operator please open the call for questions ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press star then one on your touch tone telephone if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the
from the queue please press the pound key our first question comes from the line of ken worthington with j p morgan your line is open hi im sure this will surprise you but im going to ask a question on d o l no ken after seeing the draft rules last year l p l and others in the industry contemplated moving brokerage retirement accounts
over to advisory accounts as sort of a potential solution or maybe an attractive solution based on that information based on the final rules does that option still seem at least potentially attractive or is it obviously unattractive well ken i think why don t we start a little higher level than that and ill be happy to get to that
question specifically i think what is important is that we have already announced a number changes in anticipation of the d o l including the changes we talked about in the call here around m w p and optimum market portfolios and our robo advice platform and the new mutual fund brokerage platform as well as you know it is a thousand pages there is a lot to review and understand but we are pleased that it allows us more flexibility to serve retirement brokerage accounts than the
initial proposal did so it was better than we thought it would be coming into it and it does preserve choice for the consumer for brokerage or advisory accounts so one of the things that we think is helpful is to think about what are the principles that we are operating under this new world which will guide us to the question like yours number one is transparency fees and services that get
disclosed and are available via websites and materials such as confirms accounting opening information and other investor disclosures so that transparency is really critical to consumers understanding what they are paying for number two is reasonable compensation investors should pay reasonable fees for the services they receive and advisors are entitled to receive reasonable compensation
for the services they provide number three that we want to use our scale to drive value and that we plan to use our industry leading position to benefit retail investors as well as advisors as we can add services and keep costs down and that will grow our business and that benefits our shareholders as we think about changes like the department of labor
rule change and then finally we want to preserve choice that is the heart of what independence is all about and it is our mission to enable advisors to make independent recommendations that are in the best interest of their clients so that is our guiding principles around which we are thinking about the changes that are here it is important to understand now really to specifically your question ken advisory is certainly a good option for many but we want to only
have the advocacy or change of moving to advisory when it is in the best interest of the client and so while we talked about mechanics of movement and others in the industry have done the same they were always guided by what is best for the client in their situation and one example you can have a client who needs occasional advice
who has just received a rollover as they move from one job to another and they basically need a quick check probably not even a financial plan so much as an asset allocation idea if they are long term investors those can be done very nicely in brokerage at a relatively low cost over time and ongoing advice may not be appropriate if it is a relatively small amount or they are very early in their career
careers and just do not have the kind of complexity and needs of a financial plan and in other case it can be someone much later in their career with a sizable rollover or needing to have ongoing financial planning advice and advisory account might make more sense because they are paying ongoing fees every year for those services so its a complex question that really has to be answered
by client and by what is best for them that said the mechanics of moving accounts is relatively straightforward and part of what we certainly have been working on are making that easier things like being able to keep an account number when an account moves from one type of an account to another that is a good thing to have in any case so certainly continue to do that but i think at this stage what is attractive is how do we best serve consumers and what the d o l has done
is create a solution to the issue of creating a fiduciary brokerage account by preserving choice and that is the most important thing of all great thank you hopefully as a thought this is not too in the weeds but the b i c which i think the industry thought was unworkable now seems to be at least from an operational perspective workable from a functional perspective however is
the b i c exemption something that is attractive either broadly or maybe more finely to l p l yes i think a b i c exemption is attractive because it preserves choice and therefore allows us to really engage advisor to engage with a client or a prospect around what is best in their particular situation and so by the changes
that were made it certainly made it quite workable and again we thought they would make a number of changes they made more than we planned so we are quite pleased with the fact that they listened and really acted in the best interest of keeping choice available for consumers so it is something that is workable its something that we intend to support and feel comfortable with working our way through the details of it okay awesome thank you very much
sure absolutely ken our next question comes from the line of christian bowl oo with credit suisse your line is open good afternoon mark good afternoon matt so yeah another question on d o l unfortunately so i guess you get revenue share from product manufacturers in your hybrid r i a business and thats similar to peers like schwartz so nothing unique to l p l but
curious kind of how that gets impacted by the d o l proposal well it does appear from everything we read and again a very large document that has come out is that all third party compensation can continue to be received on the brokerage side the b i c is used and on the advisory side as has been the practice in the industry there is still a lot more to sort through and understand and make sure things
are reasonable in terms of how compensation is paid and that is i think still the work before as we go to spend more time on the details of the rule okay and then maybe couple of for my follow up couple of clean up financial questions i guess from promotional expenses i guess one million dollars up sequentially
versus your guidance last quarter of five million growth you mentioned lower transition assistance what drove that is there some sort of a pause in hiring because of d o l or something else and then also on the advisory fee rate that fell from a hundred and ten basis points to five basis
to a hundred and five basis points so any color on what drove that would be helpful yes so christian on transition assistance more we have talked about last quarter more seasonal so q four tended to be seasonally higher and i think that was so you see that decline into q one but keep in mind it is a hard one to predict right because each quarter is going to be based on recruiting that happens in that quarter
and then i think on the advisory fee i think it is more just highlighting the transition of assets of the hybrid platform that moves some of the assets outside of that into the r i a category will be the key thing to highlight on on the advisory side okay thank you
our next question comes from the line of bill katz with citi your line is open okay thanks so much appreciate you taking questions kind of bunch of them and the first one is as you go through the b i c can you talk a little bit about how you are sort of viewing the interpretation on shared revenue and what that might mean for
your business and the ability to continue that and how might react strategically if you had to move to more of a uniform pricing per shelf space well i think it is still too early to really fully understand all the issues with that said i think it is important to understand that we have agreements in place with the product sponsors on our platform and those standardize compensation around
any number of factors with them and have been in place for quite some time also important to understand that the agreements for the plus level sponsors do have a ten year cancellation clause in them and has been a feature since they were created in the early nineties so we feel very comfortable with where we are today and still need more time with the d o l regulations to really dig through them more deeply
but clearly again it does appear the third party compensation was specifically mentioned by the d o l and their new regulation that is there as always disclosure is really critical in this process we disclose today arrangements on our website so that is easily found by both investors and others and so we understand that that is an important feature
what the d o l wants and one that we have supported for a long time okay and then matt maybe this is getting a little too detailed i guess we were hoping that you would have a little more disclosure on some of these other ancillary expense lines what was consistent with your supplement so forgive the question here it seems like the delta of expenses was
quite dramatic if you look beyond comp promotion d and a and the brokerage line could you sort of carve out what if anything might have been unusual in the quarter or what might be a more normalized run rate for those collective line items well sure i mean i think that maybe speaking to on the financial results overall
i think the things that i would highlight looking forward from a call it from one timer perspective i think the first and foremost is on the regulatory side and the three million of cost recovery items that i highlighted that we do not expect to recur and then secondarily i would highlight on the production bonus side the advisor share based compensation which is really a mark to market item where
it averages about a million and a half a quarter of an expense it was actually a million and a half of income on this quarter so i would highlight those two things call it from a one timer standpoint and then broadly and more on the revenue side just emphasizing the i c a yield rate that i highlighted from sixty nine basis points down to the
as the anchor bank contract runs off in the mid to upper fifty in q two and then down to the low fifties for the second half of the year and maybe just from a seasonality standpoint just highlighting that production bonus that does grow throughout the year would be the other big one that i highlight so i think those are probably the most relevant ones
okay last with me thanks for taking the questions i think one of your peers is out sort of saying that hey look they think there is an opportunity for some industry consolidation as smaller platforms can not deal with the costs here of implementing the new program fiduciary reform so as you mentioned here first and foremost you are sort of
protecting the balance sheet and you sort of went through yeah there is some extra a couple million dollars sort of extra cash beyond the debt covenant how are you thinking about m and a versus other uses of capital at this point in time are we sort of in a sit tight mode as you work through the d o l over the next year plus or would you be willing to potentially use up some of the extra
liquidity to do some deals so the first and best use of capital i think we would all agree is in organic growth of platform and we do think that these changes as we have been leading on our front feet in terms of making positive changes for investors and advisors can lead to more recruiting opportunities our first place to want to use capital
second place would be m and a and we agree that things like this tend to squeeze cost structures for smaller competitors we are the market leader in the i b d space but that does not tell us what prices are for m and a and that is obviously part of what we need to understand in any transaction so all things being equal we would agree that this is likely to lead to more opportunity for m and a
as a good use of capital at the right prices bill there so i think we are aligned in that thinking but matt i do not know if you would add anything else no it is well said i think i would just add to any deployment of capital i mean things that we are focused on is making sure were comfortable with where the macro environment is heading in our views on the impact of d o l i mean thats going to govern our comfort on deploying capital in general
but agree with what you said on where we deployed to okay i woud like to follow up offline thanks so much thanks bill our next question comes from the line of steven chew back with nomura your line is open hi good evening hi steve so one of your competitors recently announced that it will stop offering load mutual funds on its platform and as you
see some of your competitors take such actions do you see a risk that others ultimately follow suit and as a quick follow up to that do you can you disclose what percentage of your mutual fund commissions actually come from loads versus trails well let us start with the broad question basically the announcement was done by a firm that does very little load fund sales
so essentially their model is an employee model done through their branches which essentially are selling advisory products often with their own e t f s as the answer so it is an advisory based solution that is there as i understand it from an investment news article from today that firm talked about that being less than seven hundred and fifty trades over the last two years so thats
a de minimis amount of transactions so i think it sounds like they are just cleaning up their approach to the way they operate their branches but other than that the news reports i do not know more than that so i do not see this as anything relevant to the question of choice for consumers and being able to offer what seems to work best or what they will want as they think about things like rollover their i r a accounts or taxable savings or anything else so
i think that is more about an individual firms business model and what it is trying to do within that got it okay and then switching gears for a moment i had a question on the impact of your lower share price in the quarter on the earnings and on the payout side the mark to market it is pretty clear resulted in a lower non sensitive g d c payout we have seen that prior quarters so it is to be
expected but i suppose what surprised me was the elevated other income given that usually there is a resulting negative mark to market on some of those deferred comp plans which is an offset to that lower non g d c benefit and i would have also expected a lower marketing allowance as well just given the declines that we saw in the alternative investment sales
side so i did not know if you can help reconcile that discrepancy yeah i would highlight on the there is kind of two things i think through on the mark to market so the deferred comp plan i think the one is is the one you are thinking of where it is a mark to market where it impacts both production expense and other so when thinking through our management p and l
it has no impact on gross profit on the other plan which typically you do not see much noise in because it is the stock based or stock compensation plan for advisors that was mark to market as well and with a drop in stock price that mark to market falls to the bottom line so i think it is more that second one where you do not typically see that impact that
that is impacting things and can you quantify the net benefit from the lower share price that we saw in the quarter yeah it was a swing of about four million dollars so it was an expense of two and a half million last quarter even though that was high it is averaged about a million and a half but it was two and a half last quarter and was actually income of roughly one and a half this quarter so
so a quarter over quarter swing of around four million all right great that is it from me thank you for taking my questions thanks steven our next question comes from the line of chris harris with wells fargo your line is open thanks hey guys couple of questions on d o l the new initiatives you guys are talking about launching
robo mutual fund brokerage and i am sure perhaps there are some other things you are thinking about what are the economics of those to l p l relative to the legacy business and if a goal of these initiatives is to reduce fees for the client does that also mean lower fees for l p l that is the first part of the question second is do you guys envision
still generating revenue sharing payments from these new initiatives thanks let us take the second question first again it is a little too early to understand fully what the department of labor has brought to us in this thousand page document so were still digging our way through it it does appear though that our third party compensation is going to continue to be received on the brokerage side as long as
the b i c is used and that would be what we have anticipate as we sit here today so it seems to be affirming to that situation important to understand that most of the changes we talked about on the advisory side so that is a different world and in that case as it goes so on the your question about the economics which was your first question
important to understand that our experience has been that we make changes in pricing what happens as we gain additional assets from additional market share and that market share overcomes the cost of the changes that are made and if it does not do it in the first year it certainly does it in the second or third and so given that our experience over many years of this kind of change
we see it is as being a profitable choice from a shareholder standpoint and obviously a good solution for consumers and a good solution for advisors as well this just really helps us grow the business which is what of course were all after so i think the best way to think about it is that while it certainly is less profitable than it was before because you have made a price change in aggregate you are picking up additional assets
that create additional profits okay got it our next question comes from the line of alex cram with u b s your line is open hey good evening i am going to start with a non d o l question and hopefully it was mentioned before but i guess you talked about the payouts and the bonuses but you did not talk about
the base payout rate which has nicely trickled down over the last couple years i think eighty two a half this quarter down a whole percent so is that going to continue the trickling down what are you doing there exactly i know in the past you have talked about kind of like lower producers you are going to squeeze a little bit so what is going on there and what is the trajectory
going forward on the base yeah so alex i will start with that one and then mark obviously feel free to jump in i think at a very broad point the payouts on advisors or advisory business is lower than the payout on brokerage right so as we see the transition in advisory business grow it is driving that payout down
ever so slightly over time as you have observed so i think thats the key trend there yeah i think the only thing i would add to that is that it is not result of a change of pricing our production bonuses have stayed the same for quite some time on both the brokerage side and the advisory side and what is important is they have breakpoints that essentially works so as you have seen
our brokerage business slow down as it obviously did last year and continue doing here in the first quarter you will see that it will naturally payout less to individual practices as is the schedule basically so thats also the other dynamics you are seeing the switch that matt mentioned from brokerage advisory and then just lower production per rep
per advisor will lower the payout rate as well okay great and then now to my d o l question which is actually a little bit more big picture so i am not going to going into weeds but i guess the question is now that we have the final rules what happens next from your perspective and because you have obviously some
timelines here what does it actually mean for your business like when are you going to actually start implementing some of those things are you going to wait until april next year when are you going to communicate with your advisors when are you may be looking at some of the fee changes i mean you are obviously doing some things already right so the bigger question here is when do you think some of the behavioral changes might start from the
advisor perspective i guess also and then the second question related to that is obviously all this relates to retirement accounts but what i keep on hearing is this is just going to be way too confusing for advisors and also for end client so to what degree do you think you are going to have a similar set of rules for both retirement and non retirement going forward and then obviously that relates to maybe
the s e c is going to come and have their own rules anyway so maybe that you can address it from a big picture perspective thanks yeah thank you for that so let us start with the harmonization of the rule first your last question it is important to understand that the s e c has basically had a mandate since dodd frank was passed
has been delayed in implementation around setting the fiduciary standard we have two commissioners who have not been seated yet so out of the five commissioners two are not yet there and so it does not appear that process is going terribly quickly and clearly what is important to understand is they have got to go through a process with the s e c which
mary jo white i belief herself has said will be a slow process as they digest what the d o l has done and they understand the unique issues that they face as an agency so my own belief is the s e c will probably let this move into the next administration as a practical matter since they are down two commissioners there i do think the d o l work is helpful because it does set out
a way of thinking about essentially a central conflict that occurs in a brokerage relationship and how to think about disclosure remedies to that a concept that comes from the securities regulators as well and also how to think about just in general what is reasonable compensation so i do think it is smart as you suggest that an advisor is going to likely and we are going to want to implement in a way that tends to make those
decisions across the entire platform around both taxable and tax free accounts so a good example of that would be with the way variable annuities have changed over time in terms of pricing if you are adopting a new pricing structure one would adopt that across all account types because you are really adopting by product so were still working through the issues to understand those but we are taking into
account taxable accounts because why would not we right we are doing it and something like the brokerage account that we discussed will work both for taxable and tax free accounts and that is an important part to consider as well and i think if we think about it we know that that work then lays ground the d o l started the work lays the ground for whatever the s e c will bring which may or may not be all that
unique from here but i think we are in good shape given the thoughtfulness with which the d o l approached the issues that are there then your first question was really about what is advisor behavior and we are seeing a significantly lower brokerage activity which we definitely see as somewhat seasonal part of what is happening in markets but also structural where advisors are already making some changes we saw
an increased amount of smaller producers leaving the system in the fourth quarter that abated a bit in the first quarter and we know when talking to advisors that the fourth quarter activity was them thinking about the department of labor and thinking about their cost structure in a slower environment so we do think that there is some behavior there to make sure that they are
thinking about those changes and the last one that you talked about is that how do we think about the way that advisors prices may change over time and sort of their outlook going forward and i think they are working through those issues and what were doing for them is holding weekly calls we have a specialized telephone line
for them to call any time they like to to talk through the issues we have had extensive rollouts of our changes that were making and we have extensive materials for them to use to explain to their clients what is going on and how it is going on so we have seen this as a real opportunity to step up and use our capabilities and scale to help them answer this for themselves and then answer it for their clients as well on that we are getting very positive feedback
very high use of the services that we have and feel very good about that in the end we want to make sure that they do what is right by the clients and that is what they want to do as well and so were all aligned to that interest and so part of it is just making sure that we monitor activities or changes in product mix or changes in account type as they are appropriate for clients and they are appropriate
appropriate for building a good long term business for everybody excellent thanks for the lengthy answer our next question comes from the line of devin ryan with j m p securities your line is open hey great thanks good evening just love if you could talk a bit about the composition and size of the advisor recruiting backlog right now how thats trended more recently and if relevant how the d o l s impact in that
meaning is there more inbound from advisors at other models maybe those more focused on proprietary products or it does uncertainty around the d o l slow movement for a bit or maybe just get advisors are kind of an wait and see mode or maybe even you guys are in the wait and see mode just as you are assessing all implications
well i think we are assessing all the implications we tend not to be wait and see type of people and so as our actions of price the changes we have made the features we are introducing like lower comp balances were all done because we knew that in any scenario they would work and thats a good example of taking forward action part of taking that action also tells our existing advisors we are here help them and what tells their investors we are here to help them as well that is an important
positioning for the company to take and we know that it does influence people as they decide to move from a firm perhaps from a proprietary model or an employee model to independence i would say anecdotally we do hear that that positive feedback on what we have announced in recruiting but i do not want to put it as a wave just yet i think it is just too early to tell how thats going to be i do
think it is fair to say that that when you have had the market we have thats the bigger influence in the first six weeks of two thousand and sixteen thats a much bigger influence on movement and there is no doubt that that slows down recruiting a bit inevitably as those advisors really pay attention to their investors who get concerned in those kind of rapid sell off moments so we had a rapid recovery so that helps but
it is important that that is probably the bigger factor in my view got it okay that is helpful and then maybe when you guys think about some of the cost that will be incurred the d o l rules and then it is essentially enacted and potentially a broader fiduciary standard by the s e c down the road i know were all focusing a lot on the costs and potential revenue pressures but as you add more resulting oversight and compliance capabilities for brokers
brokers how much of that can you pass along to the brokers where there could actually maybe be some positive revenue implications as an offset should we be thinking about that as an offset to some of these higher costs yes it is still really early to tell what exactly is involved i mean if you think about it the mix change just from brokerage going to advisory advisory has a different set of
principles for overseeing it is a principles based process so there is less activity based review which implies less use of technology or less use of humans to do that so as that conversion occurs as we get more and more advisory assets you would expect us to be just more efficient at it changes that we make that put more assets in our custody at l p l also are just easier to oversee and therefore more efficient so there is definitely some positive efficiency
plays within the changes that are here as well and important to understand that as we think about the changes we certainly want to think about how are we driving successful outcomes to investors and really holding people to the right standards on the advisory side and also holding the correct standards
standards in the new d o l world as well and that implies some cost so i think today we feel comfortable with implementation cost and the good news is we have got a couple years to do it as opposed to just one and secondly were assessing the ongoing cost but because the d o l took a broader view and made the b i c more workable that certainly
feels better than before we had the new ruling got it great thanks very much mark sure our next question comes from the line of chris shut ler with william blair your line is open hey good afternoon another question on the base payout from earlier just curious what the floor is you think on that that rate if brokerage
assets continue to decline yeah hey chris this is matt i would not give a floor i mean i think the trends you have seen over the last couple years they are very small declines on a quarterly basis i think that is the best information to look at i would not have a particular number
to give you as a floor though okay and then on the d o l as we sit here today and i recognize it is early but what changes do you think need to be made to the way that your advisors use some of the higher upfront commission products i think that is a question a lot of people are wondering and i am just curious what the conversations with advisors have been like to date that may have v a s
or load mutual funds or types of products as a sizable percentage of their book do you think for instance with v a s that a good percentage of those will migrate over to a more level fee higher trail type of product and how you get comfort with the legal risk that you could be assuming there yes it is a good question again it is awfully early to tell exactly the outcome
i think there is a few things that are important to understand in terms of the d o l s view this number one the d o l itself has acknowledged rule does not require the lowest cost product or service it is not mandating that in any way and the cost is one of several factors that go into a best interest recommendation getting asset allocation right is an incredibly important part of investing money for the long term for example in a
rollover and there are other factors that might be the benefits and value of a product and service to that particular investors goals or needs when you are there so there is a lot of complexity in the way to think about what product is correct when and where i think it is also important to understand that well before the d o l there is a number of changes in the industry that were occurring
anyway one is a low interest rate environment which makes it tough for the annuity companies to create features and benefits on v a so we have seen a significant decline in v a volumes over the last several years and we do not particularly see any reason why that would change and thats fine but we do agree with you that we have seen i think helpful changes in terms of less
upfront loads and more ongoing trail and we certainly intend to continue to make sure that that is reasonable compensation as it relates to that product set and a broader asset allocation and then finally federal rule fifteen oh two as it relates to non traded rights which was both pricing and to some degree compensation is an important part of what is already changed
in the environment and you saw in fourth quarter we had a significant annualized drop in non traded rights thats also because the real estate sector is less interesting today than it was a year or two years ago and so what happens as a result of that is something called a t share which is exactly the characteristics that you describe which is a much lower upfront fee or compensation payment and then an ongoing trail that goes with it and that seems a very appropriate
structure and quite wise from the part of f i n r a to have gotten that work done several years ago that was effective january one of this year so it is in the market today okay thank you our next question comes from the line of doug me whirl ter with sun trust your line is open hi good evening i just
most of my questions have been answered i guess adding to the v a question and also fixed index annuities seem to have taken some market share from v a but i know that you were actually talking about possibly dusting the cobwebs off of a fee based variable annuity do you think
that would that momentum would continue or do you think that third party v a s and fixed index annuities would fit the bill under maybe the slightly more relaxed guidelines of the d o l rule i think we have to learn and see what is best for the customer there is a lot of innovation thats occurring in that part of the insurance market because of the low rate environment and
i think that is part of what we need to see how that works and how we can help influence it so i think within the brokerage world clearly what has happened is the d o l has taken a view that this really needs to be done under a reasonable compensation standard not on a product type standard which i think is an incredibly thoughtful change on their part and very helpful to making sure
consumers have choice and are able to get exposures to different products that are appropriate in their case so i think that helps us a lot in terms of serving their needs i do think relevant to your v a question and we were a very early innovator in bringing v a s into the advisory world we just did not find there was much demand then do i think there will be more demand over
time yes just because they are a good product for providing hedging or providing income guarantee is not the right word but income protection let us call it and so that more than likely you would see that be more interesting over time i think because the b i c is workable i think in the near term there is not particularly a reason to move on that idea but were still examining it and seeing what our advisors tell us and what their
clients tell them are going to work best okay thank you very much you are welcome our next question comes from the line of conor fitzgerald with goldman sachs your line is open good evening just maybe warn us on kind of what you are seeing from clients as markets have normalized i think you mentioned that activity was low in january and february just the volatility can you give us an
update just on what you are seeing in terms of activity levels for march and april well in march it was more normalized and that is as far as well go in our commentary in terms of it so we saw january february we re now producing the monthly information just trying to make sure theres a lots of good transparency around it so we will have
the april data out i am not sure quite when matt that comes yeah mid may and then i would just add if you notice in the release on page ten we did add the march specific monthly data and you saw what i think you would expect to see as markets calm down on the clients cash sweet balances went down as that money was redeployed back into the market kind of opposite trend you saw in the
january and february volatility so i would just highlight that to you conor that is helpful thanks and then maybe just a follow up on four oh one k rollover i guess can you help us maybe size how big a driver that is for your asset growth and how you think kind of your advisors are going to have to adjust to the rule and how they have conversations with their clients around
rollovers well that is the heart of the d o l issue is not it so i afraid we are in the same boat right which is that the b i c is more workable than we thought it would be and they are permitting any number of things that are very helpful to make that rollover conversation successful with an investor so i would say that we feel it is all workable
and preserves choice so not particularly concerned about the act of an individual working with a retail investor on a rollover specifically but we still have an awful lot more to learn about process and i think it is an important one thing i would highlight here is that because our model is an independent contractor
model we do not face the issue at some other state who have a record keeping business have their own employees as their advisors and then are trying to really essentially deal with that individual retail investor both as a four oh one k participant and then moving to a rollover we do not have the same construct that construct is harder it is always been difficult but it is even more difficult under the department of labor as we understand the new rule but i am sure they are wanting to evaluate that in our model that
has always worked well and should continue to work well because of the independent nature of each provider in that particular lineup and so i think what is the important is how we think through that rollover in terms of education disclosure and recommendations for that consumer and that is part of the detail that we need to work our way through that is helpful
thanks for taking my questions absolutely thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in the todays conference this does conclude the program and you may all disconnect everyone have a wonderful day
welcome to oracles first quarter two thousand and eighteen earnings conference call now like to turn today's call over to ken bond senior vice president please go ahead sir
thank you all a good afternoon everyone welcomed or first for fiscal year two thousand and eighteen earnings conference call
the if the press release and financial table which includes a gap in non gaap reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our investor relations website on the call today our chairman and chief technology officer larry ellison and ceos separate catz and marker
as a reminder today's discussion will include forward looking statements including predictions expectation estimates or other information that might be considered for blocking
throughout today's discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potential effects these forward looking statements
these forward looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from state is being made today
as a result we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent report including our ten k and ten q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risk
that may affect her future result for the market price of our stop
and finally we are not getting ourselves revival result public release in revisions the from citizens in line at new information for future events or taking questions will begin with a few prepared remarks with that i'd like to turn the call over to set up
thanks can good afternoon everyone i'm going to focus on our non gaap results for q one
oh then review guidance for q two and turn the call over to larry and marked for their comments
as you can see we had another good quarter customer adoption of our cloud products and services continue to be very very strong and are on premise business remains very resilient
the result was that total revenue were high end of my guidance and earnings per share beat my guidance by one penny
today i'm going to do what i always do which is used constant dollar growth rate on this call so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business
the effects of currency movements in q one we're a little better than expected with a one percent tailwind to total revenue
total cloud and software revenue were seven point four billion up eight percent in constant currency and nine percent u s dollars
yeah applications total revenue would two point six billion up seventeen percent and gap platform and infrastructure total revenue were four point seven billion up three percent
cloud sas revenue for the quarter were one point one billion sixty one percent from last year
cloud pass and i asked revenue for the quarter were four hundred and three million up twenty eight percent from last year
oh sorry yeah yeah you scale and grow dramatically the gross margin expanded
the gross margin for sas in the quarter with sixty seven percent up from fifty nine percent last q one
we expect to see further improvement in ask why eighteen and remain committed to our goal of eighty percent sat gross margin
possibly as soon as some time in f why ninety
the gross margin for path and i asked with forty four percent down fifty eight percent down from fifty eight percent last quarter as our geographic buildout goes forward in response to demand
but ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition
when we are its scale i expect to see major improvement in pass and i ask gross margin
total cloud revenue in the quarter
one point five billion ups fifty one percent from last year
hotel on premise software revenues were five point nine billion up one percent from last year reflecting continued high attached
oh software support and renewal remain rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on premise customers
hardware revenues were nine hundred and forty three million down six percent and services revenue were eight hundred and sixty million up five percent
how do revenue for the company when nine point two billion up six percent from last year
non gap operating income was three point eight billion up ten percent from last year
and it's been a while since we last reported double digit operating in gross income growth as we undertook the cloud transformation
that affected our income statement trading off line on and off flaunt revenue recognition on premise license revenue for who occurring subscription cloud revenue
with a now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue net i expect that we will see additional strong operating income growth
the operating margin was forty one percent which was up from thirty nine percent last year
the non gaap tax rate for the quarter was a twenty five percent which was over a point higher than my guidance
negatively impacted p s by penny or so and e p s was still up twelve percent in u.s.d. and eleven percent in d to sixty two cents
the gas tax rate was fourteen and a half percent and gap e p s was up nineteen percent to fifty two cents in u.s. dollars
operating cash flow over the last four quarters with fourteen point eight billion up eight percent and free cash flow over the last four quarters with twelve point six billion
capital expenditures for the quarter were four hundred and seventy three million
i expect the cloud capped at spending will be driven by our a r our growth and the path i as buildout that i mentioned earlier
obviously should we see higher than expected a r our growth we expect to see higher catholics investments as well
we now have nearly sixty seven billion dollars in cash and marketable securities but net of our debt our cash position is about thirteen point six billion
the short term deferred revenue balance is ten point three billion up nine percent in u.s. dollars
as we've said before we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation strategic acquisition stock repurchases prudent use of debt and the dividend
this quarter we repurchased ten point two million shares for a total of nearly five hundred million
we are we planted on bringing that rate up significantly or q two
over the last twelve months we repurchased forty six point six million shares for a total of two billion and we also paid out dividends of two point eight billion
do you work on board of directors again to clear a quarterly dividend of nineteen cents per share
now did the guy that and i'm going to give you guidance for q two and my guidance is on a non gaap basis and in constant currency
however there have been some currency movements
and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now currency could be as much as three percent positive on total revenue and two cent positive on s
so here we go q to cloud revenue remember these are constant currency number so you're going to be adjusting them for u s dollars
cloud revenues including sad pass and i as are expected to grow thirty nine to forty three percent total revenue growth is expected to range from two percent to four percent
non gap e p s in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between sixty four and sixty eight percent up from sixty one percent last q two
that puts the the number in the range between sixty six
and seventy seven
today's exchange rate
this assumes a non gaap hatchery somewhere between twenty three and a half and twenty five and a half of course the as usual tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter with that
noise oh turn it over to mark for his comic
um the strong quarter or birds across virtually every metric that we track usaid total revenue was up seven operating income was up eleven e p s up twelve
because there was a strong quarter overall growth was above forty percent that with an acceleration from our growth rate last year
by the way all number jersey documents i say otherwise
i'd revving up fifty one percent now have six billion dollar run rate eighty percent of our t t m trailing twelve months offered cloud revenue is now recurrent
i'm going to give you some sas revenue numbers by pillar were up sixty one percent as separate said accelerating from fifty five percent growth last year the p was up ninety percent organically
overall europe he is now over one point three billion annualized run rate fusion eight cm up one hundred and nine percent more than double the growth rate of work debt
the ex all of our category sales good service rep double digits organically eight is a service was up to fifty three percent the business now over half a billion new minds run rate
or verticals were up twenty percent on a computer by the way of a hundred and fifteen percent growth last year
and as good as always asked numbers are application ecosystem
let me go through again with that is that is or on premise license on premise support and sas was together up seventeen percent
when you look at any industry growth metric of the applications to industry your pi.n. numbers like one two three in the marketplace and market share gains we are sounding
the pads infrastructure revenue was up twenty eight percent business analytics were up one hundred and thirty percent eight integration up two hundred and twenty one percent
our database ecosystem including the same metrics i described earlier databases service on premise support on premise license was up three percent state
in one with industry market growth georgian compute industries a service were both up triple digits cloud deferred revenue was up fifty three percent
there was that describes a solid quarter for us and top line growth is seven percent u s d in twelve percent in revenue in twelve percent e p s growth in the u.s. state a couple of protections
i expect you to club booking growth to be strong or stronger than our q one growth rate our cloud bookings were executed well on a very big and growing pipeline
we expect the cloud halfway to the full year cloudbook you have to be quite strong revenue growth now an annualised rate of six billion dollars or growth rate of fifty one percent and we are the fastest growing cloud company is scale
or do you want to read off to a few logos of ways we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that were selling product to and i'll just mention a few but in eight cm this is eight cm cloud sass

gm without altering over to thank you mark on october fourth did or a globalized world will announce the next generation of the oracle database when we deliberate by the end of this calendar year oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous dead
it's a machine learning this new version of horrible is totally automated the self driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or too
you know artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error and they both auroville to deliver unprecedented reliability in the cloud
we will be offering
oh my so service local agreements for the work will database that guarantee ninety nine point nine nine five percent systems availability time ninety nine point nine nine five percent availability mean less than thirty minutes
oh plan or plan down time per year
to achieve that level of reliability or to audit to achieve that level of run liability or it will have to automatically tomb pack and upgraded several while the system is running
they w do any of this
but perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self driving car or turn our new self driving database are the economics that surround total omission
noise so i think cars eliminate the labor costs plus the high cost associated with human driving
still driving database eliminates the labour car the tuning managing and upgrading the to day while avoiding all of the coffee costly downtime associated with human error
so daunting huh much cheaper to operate in taxis with human driver
running a work autonomous day to day is much much cheaper than running traditional human driven databases like amazon's red shift
customers moving from amazon to register the oracle dot on the database
can expect to cut their costs in half and or who will be providing dr outlet that guarantee those cost savings to customers
you only you have to be for q and a portion of the call
thank you ladies and gentlemen to ask the question press star then one on your telephone keypad our first question is going to come from the line of sara hensley and mccorry
alright great thank you very much thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter don't from his business is i'm definitely feeling better about world says seeing and hearing more about very large marquee customer wins across your cloud portfolio
and um now you're
is actually growing seventeen percent in constant currency which implies you're taking market share snow
i'm wondering um you know what you're seeing in terms of momentum and not clouds portfolio and down where you see that heading and if there's really any benefit coming in from these uh these large reference customers
um
sure yeah i mean i i personally i have one thing you said about implying we're taking merck unsure i just want to make sure it's clear we are
so it's and and that's why i've been trying to give this number over a longer period of time that he s marketplaces growing low single digits and obviously we've been out and doing this for for a long period of time in terms of growing at this rate but there is no question to your point that
you know when you can come out with with references like we have publicly with bank of america eighteen tee and others it makes the next
a opportunity easy when you can reference customers at that level so i think again and we said this book orbiter properly bear seeing dan that just sort of every aspect of selling in the cloud i think the company holistically is getting better
yeah we're better you know our products are better or sales forces better our ability to implement is better our ability to do all of these things is just continued to improve quarter by quarter by quarter and it manifests itself in the test results
talking about this afternoon
yeah i'll i'll just uh i if you look at the growth rate of our applications business in the cloud
uh in excess of sixty percent and you compare that to either work their sales for the two other major players application players mcleod you know they're not even close
over a much bigger than the work day and applications and and ever growing faster
must be taking care and there are primary competitor in both by eight c m and e r p
a silk horses been had been at it for fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen years they've been for a very very long time but we sell more new applications customers
then they do every year definitely be clear we sell double
w what silk yourself an absolute dollars
uh we did it last year and will do more than not this year and we are growing and we catching them very very fast
so to just reinforce what marks that we are taking share we are taking share across the entire applications ecosystem and we're taking share from our cloud primary customers about competitors as well
sorry just to add that jordan long day he had trouble to talk more about this a financial analyst day after oak for concludes
but again or support business in applications when we do move a customer from our support business to our cloud business
we we've not done several days we get materially more revenue we talked about this before but i it bears sanity and because we sort of stopped talking about it we get at least three times more revenue
oh y for like basis when a customer moves from on premise support to our cloud
and we really just just begun to move that user base most of what's in our application clout growth that larry just talked about new logos
that the please our next question will come from the line of cash rankin bank of america
hi congratulations one question marks in every one for safra a key talk about the disclosure that came out eight k you talked about some really ambitious plans for you assess business at ten billion dollars in revenue
past nine ten billion dollars as well you talk about what kind of time frame or you likely to achieve this in
how much of this is from acquisitions verses
organic and questioned for yourself if you are able to achieve these ambitious targets laid out how should we think about the margin structure of the company acid thank you
oh let me let me just jump in your hands and say that uh we also have an eighty dollars a share stock price target the part of the comp lamb
we also have a target that says will be doubled on the market cap of ibm double the market cap of a as a p i mean there are a lot there are a lot of targets here in terms of march and we have a cloud margin target that i think i think that eighty percent
so uh we're actually we're well on our way to achieving insects margin the target so we expect the margins in our businesses to go up
the stock price to go up
us to distance ourselves from our our if you will our legacy competitors and join the ranks of the new generation of tech companies as microsoft has done and
oh yeah and smaller companies like sales force and work that that's where we position ourselves so we think we think these are stretched targets
uh and it will take several years to achieve them but we think we are well on our way we obviously believe they are achievable but it will require sustaining because the performance we delivered over the last couple of quarters
and acquisitions larry and is a forecast the middle or you don't know what i would love who would you who there is no one left to buy you know it's not like there are a lot of obvious as we focus on the cloud
i there are a bunch of obvious targets we can go blocked by so
we are seeing our best growth and technology that we've developed in traffic are are usually or p pugin eight cm which is the the bed market and the high end of the r p and and that american high end of h t m b s and turn we develop systems
oh there you know m european bank blended rate is growing triple digits
uh the size of these markets are enormous and we think that we'll be able to ride that horse
ah you know pursue that organic growth and meet our target so i think i think it's going to be primarily come from internally develop technologies
ah the great you know the growth of those technologies within us and was gaining dramatic amounts of share and applications in the cloud and with our new them as database also and our platform of the service
and uh and infrastructure the service we have to get on all cylinders firing but the bulk of our technologies that will determine our success things like our database and our fusion application sweet
all organically
our next question is going to come from the line of bread zelnick with credit suisse
great thanks very much and really nice quarter guys especially for q one i've got a question for mark in a quick follow up for staff for a mark the apps ecosystem is off to a really strong start with seven
percent growth in the quarter but with comps getting tougher in the back half of the year as you left and that sweet you still feel that the apps ecosystem can achieve your double digit growth goal for the full year
yes
yeah
i think that uh i start i said this i think at the beginning at towards the end of last fiscal year that i believe we grow roughly double digits in or applications ecosystem and
this q one probably did nothing more than reinforced my belief that is what we as good as it was it s what we saw what happened and i believe you will see that for the full year our pipeline shows it everything else we have got shows that this will happen
right facts and just for safra sat for a mapping cloudy or or to revenue has been fairly straightforward for sas but but less so for pazz and i as is there any color you can give us just to help understand the revenue trajectory for paths and i asked thanks very much
yeah we're actually holding
uh over ten more points on the past dyads right now
uh because we've had a lot of quarter and we are deploying them and will only start recognizing them as they deploy first of all all of our cloud demur
the a very large amount of that is uh has been a fully out deploy so you're going to start seeing these match up
a lot more and so as we go ahead and deploying guess those up and running and and
uh life
i don't know mark you want to have know it's it's it's exactly right which offer said we just uh i have good news good news is we have a large john provision backlog
and so we will get that provision and you will start to see that folded door q to one q three numbers as we get that provision so the good news is we just got a lot pass to go provision
uh i wish we got to know provision than a in q one but but we didn't
oh that's on that is really good work
great thank brad next question please our next question comes from the line of adam whole twist moffett nathanson
oh hi everyone it's it's good to be back on a noriko call in to see you all executing so well
um my question is on the decline of business and how that relates to the strengths on premise you were obviously very strong both applications and its structure on premise in the quarter
do you think that the hardening of your cloud infrastructure and the strength your cloud applications businesses actually starting to have a positive impact on on premise revenue and and how do you think that dynamic ways going forward
well uh the implications business in the cloud business i should business in the tech business i transitions from on trend to cloud are very different
but as we move our application customers from on the cloud we're asking them to migrate from the e business week
to a fusion as they moved from our our age are asking them to migrate from or you know or at jar or people saw a big jar diffusion h r mcleod so they're really changing application
in the case of our technology business where you are running the oracle database on premise or just asking you to lift to move your data into our class there really is no technology transition at all
so the yeah you really can't look at these transitions is being similar
the interesting thing is very different let the microsoft microsoft they took their existing microsoft office customers and move them to the clout thirty something you can save documents and the word documents are called documents the class that's what he meant by
yeah officers sixty
not very close to our database business where we are just beginning to move them to the cloud of taking existing applications actually the new version of our database as i mentioned is greatly enhanced
oh in in that there is real motive motives and move it from on brand into the cloud lots and lots of benefits but it's not a technology change
and our transition you absolutely moved to a whole new technologies
it was like almost moving to a new bender you well are you move from horribly business leader people saw financial or jd edwards all of these on crown customers that we have on crime business we have and he moved to the fusion pineapple
that was a you know that recorded in new implementation retraining your people and we did that but we know that transition as marked that joe is just beginning most of our fusion europe d customers are views and h.c.m. customers are new logo
and uh we don't expect
when people move their day to day database from on crime in the cloud we didn't expect support to go we expect to just to bring their licenses into our cloud
and the are paying support you have a lot of since you own the lessons now you rather it our cloud and you and you pay pets additionally for on in our cloud just look you move our daily orval database in the amazon club you pay them additional so it is simply lifting up your existing license therefore some e g support
keeping support and you add on for the infrastructure the service or of platform as a service fees associated with running and our clap
so we think that's a much easier transition process
then the transition we're making on the outside of the business
and look how low the transition on the outside of the distances is gone
terrific thank you and our next question will come from the line of kirkman turn with evercore
very much and i have my congrats on the quarter mark obviously a lot of momentum and e r p right now i was wondering when you look at where the market is today if you think we're getting closer to two more of a tipping point in terms of larger customers
yeah setting up to make decisions on moving their ear since the cloud over the next twelve to eighteen months and when you talk to customers what are some of the reasons are as feedback you're getting that gives you confidence you know in terms of taking market share and this cycle if we're about to go into one
banks
want to see we're getting a lot of uh we have strong growth we had another acceleration just in terms of logos
we had acceleration of e r p logos vis q one versus last q one so we had more closures in terms of numbers of accounts and we have bigger companies working
so it's it's it's significant to the point of your question we also have more modules coming along so if you look at what we we got in the european now
we have more vocalizations across more geographies and we have our full suite of the r p supply chain procurement manufacturing now budget and planning all available so it the false sweet now across all loss
all of our geography
what hilarious point i think it worth steady a lot of or your p customers and our new logos
lots of new financial its customers and left the company that to be very blunt redicker we would never have sold to five or six years
companies that are really name but when you come to a oracle open world you'll see another string of customers
who never had an oracle application before until they bought oracle financials in the cloud so it is that then in addition to that i think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only sweet provider
so the fact that no company instead of having a bunch of point solutions can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring eight cm
i am european together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across
basically all of our customers so you see now in the names i wrote i read off to you what to what i would call tying in mid market lowland enterprise customers that are really the current persona through we sell to most of them knew logos
i think you'll see that continue as we go forward the best news i can give you is that when we start to bring our larger customers over oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything form
we do the hardware we do the operating system we get it's our data center we do really everything form and we get the extra revenue as a result of that
thank you
our next question will come from the line of fill winslow with wells fargo
i think says in the grass on a great start to the year
i just wanted to focus on the platform and infrastructure side in particular and as you look over at the overall numbers you are still put up very healthy growth rates here you know both obviously in the cloud with the paths offering but also on premise a marker whenever you double click on just what you are seeing on premise even as that has is ramping that's keeping that business growing and then question larry obviously we are excited to hear about the new features
we 're coming an open world but what do you think about
yeah the oracle paths offering versus other infrastructure service plus and mass out there why is it that you know the oracle cloud country can lower costs more than these competitors and therefore megan gain share there
okay they're wanting to me i guess they want me to go first i b
the reason we we can lower costs is with this automate more
uh there's a big difference between what amazon basically basically does what they'd pioneered was this notion of yeah we will we will let you based on what you use computer
and storage uh and you've been going to bring whatever saw in and we and then they offer a couple of databases the offer aurora which is my sequel their version of mine sequel and the author red shift
uh which is another their version of an open source database they'd made some changes to with no reference works from amazon upper query queries and ultimately but these are our technologies that are not automatic these or if you will
old fashioned technologies and a new fangled cloud datacenter and available parental so it's kind of an interesting new business model but their database technologies are not buried them all they're just picked him up the open source
uh and our database
are the latest especially the latest generation of our database totally automates everything
so you down you push a button with your data and you're done
you don't have lost tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do at amazon evidence on requires a lot of labor to set up to set up an online transaction processing system based on a roar
i felt a lot of my sequels kind of our you know it code that we maintain we know a very very well
uh
very different than or you press the button load your data roger analytics
it tunes itself back to silva attaches itself it never goes down and it is much much much faster and i keep saying much much better mental they will we do not need that speed let me translate
if it is much much much to in other mother if it doesn't an hour what red shift does in ten hours
it one tenth the cost of running and amazon because we charge the same amount per hour
so we take out the labor costs and because we're we consume less cpu one week and we compressing the data and we consume less storage is much too were much more frugal about using compute and storage resources and we eliminate the labor costs
and be associated with the a corporate vegetables with human error so is we're not even trying to do the same thing as amazon
do your other question uh well listen i think there's a uh a strong interest across the board and we've got obviously new features that come with release twelve know about all those with multi tenant within memory except obviously or security options are
very important given the world that we live in today we have a desire for many of our customers to get out of all of its work
to get out a patchy
to look at modernising their infrastructure you may have heard what eighteen t talked about they'll also be open to open and will be a lot more directly from them but the need to not just consolidate
uh matches get the new features to modernize those applications but to get out of all this work
to the point to larry describing about now the fact that i can't deal with the amount of time it takes to pay
all these hybrid environments
oh somebody i oracles going to do that for me and i going to modernise the database going and give me all these features for genetic take all that work of commercial
so there's a tremendous amount of this now the letters other point remember most of our customers sick with some of the day to day they have over ten thousand oracle databases
a company and so you're going to have a handful of those big ones moved to the cloud is still going to be quite a few of those a day on premise for a period of time so that work is just a lot of work for us to help and this is the beginning of a whole string a customers
'm going to go through this process modern database environments
our next question will come from the line of john defeat cheap jefferies
thank you
thanks i i have a have a quick just a very quick question on the guidance and then if i could ask another question just just a clarification you said total revenue could see could see i think a three percent benefit
on top of the two to four percent guidance you gave for total revenue rea i think and i i know the math is easy here but it want to make sure that implies i believe of five to seven percent reported revenue growth if you get that three percent f x effect
is that right yeah we do and that math for u.s. d i'm going to go through the entire thing in be free
okay uh um i i you are not the only no in fact you are not the only know
not the only know so i'm going to go through it for total cloud forty one to forty five percent
okay so it's really comes out like four and a half to six and a half but i'm going to say ford said
percent and in total revenue and n e p s sixty six percent to seventy seven
at making gps grow somewhere between seven percent and thirteen percent okay
oh okay
yeah that's
that's very helpful but i'm the only know you need to read but that's okay you're always getting there are a bunch of renowned being you know by the seven
four to six and somewhere in the middle there so i'm always being conservative so they poured six on the call
right
you know me okay
oh great yeah just
just just a quick one um it it 's great to see the model work in the sas business with scale driving leverage here and i know you're going to see you say we're we're also going to leverage in the past and infrastructure is a service business the scale again and others a lot of variables here but can you help us
when we're looking out when we might see this happen when we might see this turn either the timing and next year the hereafter or or or even the scale when the business hits proximately what scale
okay so it's it's a little bit complicated because there is a mismatch between i asked him pad
yes in particular extremely extremely extremely profitable and however there's really a question of when
when w w
oh when the revenues get recognised
and how much investing i have to do and how we line those up so we are
just like you signed sas i know that at the time it seemed absolutely impossible that we would have the kind of margins we now have staff and seemed impossible and yet they came and now you know we're closing in on
we're closing in on the eighties so much so that i actually went ahead and gave you sometime next year for that asking
has and i yeah uh are uh are very much at least at this point in the expansion period we expect this to be a very large business the we remain very conscious
ah the uh of the margin
and so we're trying not to invest too much i had of revenue recognition but as you see in this quarter alone
we have a lot that has yet to be deployed fully deployed even though into fully provision even though the equipment is all bought and bain capital
so this is really i can't give you an exact time because we're going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that and for us it's much more important that we began
uh quickly of course mindful of margin dollars sometimes not as mindful necessarily have any interest quarter margin percentage it
so i didn't know if you want to know john there is no mystery to the throat this is just like the as business you have to build out some initial infrastructure to get started to build but unfortunately you have to put her from wind before you can sell
and that's what this is there's a start up costs to getting in these businesses were past that in sas
are deployed in now virtually all of the critical geographies and we now have scale in most of the critical geographies and so you see it just show up in the margin rate is that we are going through that same process and infrastructure the great news for us and we know how this works
we know how to get it done we know how to measure it we know how to get from here to there and so you'll see the same results so it's just a factor of of time scale and bookings in sampras last point the ability then for us to get a provision so we can and
so this is going to happen
okay thank you that that all makes sense but should should we expect that we might need more scale i he would have developed similarly house to house did or would we expect to hit certain margins we'd have to get even greater scale in this business
no i don't think there's any material difference in the context of scale the same fundamental that 's what i'm trying to go through you've got a or up to got to get a data center you've got to unused capacity to get started and then the increments
of capacity to bookings comes at a very attractive merge
so think of it as you have a baseline of acts
and then i get a ball and then i i have a little bit of capacity per so to speak it not exactly how it works but for the sake of of your analytics and how it works and we know what that increment
oh capacity is for that book and then it's just a question of scale from there so you take the unused space and then for each booking you get so few a couple of few cents on the dollar the at root growth capacity the just become the time it takes
oh you get a scale that it
creates very helpful thanks
and our final question for today will come from the line of lima lenschow barclays
right know your line is open
thank you maybe the anticipation of the l s data slightly more broader question there you start to use kind of
the i to kind of come up with the autonomy's database can you talk a little bit about like one more uh how you kind of see this whole thing of all of them because there's obviously a lot of noise a lot of hype around that some of the other a competitive has come up with ten thousand names here how to you guys see this play out for you guys
thank you
well uh where we re using machine learning all over the place i mean everything from at the very highest level two in our hr systems
our recruiting systems to look at a bunch of candidates
um it's kind of inspects the data of people that this company is higher that had been very successful
and people who have been lost us hope that we can actually start a bucket the candidates in this group you got two hundred people you're looking at higher than the fifty over here look very much like that that that that the people that that you hire over the last five years at an enormous successful for the company
uh the odometer machine learning using machine learning they just look at the profiles of individual come a are to repair dawn and make recommendations on how to prioritize candidates that they're looking about make in looking at making offers to all the way from that level
do our new security systems which are going in now
uh where we're doing a log inspection where we're looking at
people on the end of the month we look at unlike anybody else we we are in the applications business
we are in a database business
and we're in the cloud infrastructure of business looking at network network logs and operating system law storage stuart parkway log rolling it database we we're looking at people trying to log on to applications systems in the password their use and we have all of these law
and we're processing all of these laws in our cloud
do for example looking you know trying to find people who are going to attack
a database and steal passwords and still there
and we we think we do this better than anybody because we will look at more data
we look at application that in other words we we suddenly noticed that you're c f o is in the ukraine trying to drive a lot on
to fifty thousand times in the middle of the night maybe maybe your theo not vacationing in the ukraine enough that brought her and there could be a problem with some is trying to break it
uh we look at that level of data all the way down to ip addresses that are strange idea addresses trying to figure out we live extreme sequel to anyway with we do much we look at
more blog information than someone might this block who was the backing ip addresses but not log in information
so we we get a much better picture
all the all the activity of what's going on inside your data center and use machine learning to is about inspected vast amount of data and see a film of the reconnaissance days prior to an attack
where we can sort of all they're just looking around before the athlete attack anything and it starts as daily backward stealing data
uh i get that all all machine learning we're offering that technology is going and over the world we are offering the customers can ship their logs from their data center
uh and into work cloud and will do all of the all of that security reconnaissance insecurity work for them
uh and the more of this information we have the better equipped we are defined malware you buy malware showing up in but say germany
oh and when it we know what it looked like and suddenly we have worldwide alerts because worldwide alerts that to to recognize that malware that you show up in california or at a and as we know there there's a lot of uh
security is getting more and more important these days the events that equifax
very unfortunate
uh invented acrobats is not going to be an isolated incident you see more and more things like this you saw at the government office a personnel management was which was disastrous for our intelligence community
uh we've got to do a better job we had to do a better job of securing not only our cloud but our customer data centers getting all of that law data using machine learning
too yeah and basically what is a cyber war that's going to be ongoing for a long long time so everything from helping companies using a guy to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers
both private data centers and public debt is that they deserve protect against intrusions
i important new technology and it said or what we are doing with database automation security and our application
okay thank you either
hello and call will be available for twenty four hours dial in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today is called investor relations department the follow up questions from this call look forward to speaking rejoined save that will turn it back to college for causing

take your questions now i'd now like to turn the call over to doug
thank you very much andrew good morning and thank you for joining our call this morning to discuss virtues second quarter results i will begin the call by discussing the results of
our business and the report on important progress on various strategic initiatives overall the second quarter was characterized generally by low levels of volume and volatility across all global markets which presented
a challenging environment the quarter did however end on a strong note with the results of the u k referendum on the e u producing heightened levels of activity in the final two trading
days of the quarter while breaks it certainly had a positive impact in the final week of june it did not change the overall tone of the volume and volatility of the quarter
despite this challenging environment virtue performed well throughout the quarter and generated one hundred and two point three million dollars of adjusted net trading income an average of approximately one point six
million dollars per day i will review some of the highlights of each of the various categories we report our americas equity results were down seventeen percent versus the prior quarter against
the backdrop of a fifteen percent decline in share volume and a fourteen percent decline in notional value traded in u s equities implied volatility as measured by the vix was down twenty
four percent during the period notably implied volatility continued outpace realized volatility with the ratio between the two measures declining to eighty seven percent as i have noted in prior calls and
in other public remarks realized volatility is a better predictor of the opportunity of a true market making firm such as virtue realized volatility is a useful met metric as it captures the
intraday volatility in the u s equities market which typically will reflect the bid offer spread investors are willing to pay for liquidity against this backdrop of volume declines and muted realized and
implied volatility the firm performed as anticipated during the quarter in our u s equity segment our european and asian pacific equities businesses continued to perform well comprising twenty four percent of our
adjusted net trading income for the first six months of two thousand sixteen taken together these businesses were up fifteen percent and two percent compared to q two two thousand fifteen and the first
half of two thousand fifteen respectively european equities performance was strong on a relative basis as results were down six percent versus the prior quarter while con sided consolidated european equity volumes were
down eight percent on a share volume basis and thirteen percent on a notional value basis asia pacific equities performance was even strong as results were up fifteen percent versus the prior
quarter while volumes overall were down sixteen percent we continue to benefit from growth in many of the unique market places in asia in particular in japan and we believe that the
need for the firm's market making services in the region will continue to grow as evidenced by the strategic investment we made in july in a key japanese market center that i
will comment comment on later during the second quarter our global commodities business under performed some of the benchmark metrics overall results were down thirty percent versus the prior quarter while volume of
selected bench while volumes on selected benchmarks on the ice and cme declined between eight and fourteen percent in addition to the decline in volumes we would also point to volatility as a key reason
for the the decline in results as is the case for us equities business realized volatility in the key commodities market was down significantly for example the c bo energy sector volatility was down twenty
nine percent and the c bo oil e t f vix index was down twenty eight percent finally each of the key publicly available volume benchmarks for spot and futures and foreign exchange market volumes
markets showed declines in volume during the quarter from the low to mid teens in terms of percentages it is important to note that this decline includes the impact of the somewhat
unexpected outcome of the breaks it vote at the end of the quarter which resulted in record or near record volumes days for some of these future and spot fx platforms compared
the prior quarter c m e's future a d v was down eleven percent and the notional value of c m e's futures was down ten percent hotspot a d v was down eleven percent reuters was down nine percent and
e b s was down seventeen percent overall our global currencies results were down eighteen percent and given the lack of volatility in most of the quarter we would consider this in line with
market metrics we continue to believe that our global currencies business will be a driver of growth for the firm in the near to medium term future as we saw favorable trends
in certain segments of the global commodities market most notably in the overseas n d f market places now i would like to touch on progress that we have made on several key strategic
initiatives during the quarter each of which will contribute contribute to the growth and diversity of our overall business as you know we announced a strategic minority investment in s b i japan next s b i japan next
is a thriving japanese pts venue or or alternative market place and virtue is an active market maker on the platform we decided to make the investment for several reasons we were invited
by japan next to do so in the context of overall enhanced relationship and we were honored to be selected by this leading platform to be a key strategic partner we believe that
this reflects well on the market making services we have historically provided to this platform and our reputation as being a firm that enhances markets globally this transaction also brings us closer
to japan japan next's corporate parent s b i securities a leading online broker in japan and a key participant in that country's financial markets s b i also provided us financing at an attractive rate to complete
the transaction and we be we believe japan next will be a key participant in the evolution of market structure in a in a very important part of the world as a result of the transaction we
will own approximately twenty nine percent of japan next and have one board seat which i will occupy while we are not in the business of making financial investments this investment is important
to the firm as japan next is a key strategic partner and we also believe we made this investment at an attractive entry point for firms like japan next we believe firmly that this
expanded relationship with japan next will result in continued growth in our apac business which already highly successful let me turn next to our j p morgan morgan partnership which we announced today j p morgan
has been an important and valued business part of virtue since our founding j p morgan is well acquainted with the firm as our prime broker and clearing partner in a variety of
asset classes as a lead underwriter of our initial public offering and from virtue serving as a designated market maker for j p r j p morgan stock on the floor of the new york stock
exchange we believe therefore that this strategic partnership with j p morgan chase where by virtue will provide technology and market access to j p morgan is a natural evolution of our relationship
and we are greatly humbled by the trust they have placed in virtue specifically j p morgan will use virtues technological capabilities to access and trade dealer to dealer market in u s treasuries
agreement is for a minimum of three years this is important to virtue for several reasons first it is an opportunity for virtue to scale its robust and efficient technology and connectivity
business in fixed income long in asset class we have endeavored to grow with one of the pre eminent global banks second we believe it is a win win for both firms
as virtues technological powers and micro market structure knowledge will be paired with j p morgan's u s treasuries trading acumen finally we believe that this validates further virtues strategy of partnering with financial
institutions by providing leading technology technology that allows those financial institutions to be more nimble and responsive while reducing cost while we do not expect the material impact to our financial results
in the near term we seek to make this initial phase part of a longer term and growing our relationship with a key strategic business partner finally i am pleased to report
on the progress of our agency execution services initiative during the second quarter we connected to one client who began using virtues order routing technology the early feedback has been extremely positive
with virtues generating efficiency and reduced market impact for the client we are on boarding additional blue chip buy side firms in the u s and are putting in place the mechanism it needs to to
begin providing similar services in europe we are excited about the prospects for this business and have a backlog of buy side firms in the u s and europe ready to onboard
as we have said in prior calls we view as a velvet rope offering that leverages virtues existing technology with without adding to to technology personnel or over overhead costs in any significant manner and in
this way we will continue to build this business out while we are not ready to provide estimates as to the potential size of this business in a previous call i mentioned
that we would undertake this initiative to demonstrate the leverage ability and scalability of virtues technology and to contribute meaningfully to virtues revenues over the long term i mentioned that ten percent of
our two thousand and fifteen adjusted net trade income was an ambitious benchmark that we would aspire to and we continue to maintain that as our goal the technology in trading partnership
with j p morgan and our execution services initiative are very exciting to virtue as they demonstrate the scalability and applicability of our technology to various uses uses and importantly will provide sources of
revenues to virtue that are not wholly tied directly to market volumes and volatility i'll finish my remarks by noting how the perform how the firm performed on the trading days where the market was
reacting for the breaks it vote in the u k given the market volatility in volume surrounding the breaks it vote virtue had trading days that were quite strong more importantly our systems performed flawlessly
and there was no strain in terms of performance or capacity we do not disclose the specific adjusted net trading income results of any given day as i have mentioned in the
past the announcements of any single day be it breaks it august twenty fourth of last year or the swiss de pegging is not necessarily indicative of the impact that a particular event
had on overall on our overall result the days that followed breaks it were were also active and resulted in above average adjusted net trading income and given our global operations and diversified platform the impact
of an even like breaks it while extremely positive cannot be measured as a single event in terms of the longer term impact of breaks it there obviously remains significant uncertainty about the u k's role
and ultimate relationship with the e u as you may know we access the european markets through our wholly owned subsidiary in dublin we have no offices in the u k we do not an anticipate
any meaningful impact on our ability to conduct business in in europe or the u k however as i have mentioned it remains early days now i will turn the co call over to our
c f o joseph moe loose oh to review our financial results for the third quarter joe
thank you doug i'll review the summary of our results and point out some figures with regard to expenses before we open it up to questions our gaap net income before attribution
to non controlling interests was thirty nine point three million which equates to twenty one cents per share of diluted gaap eps consistent with the financial presentation in our ten k and
ten q we provide non gaap financial information to supplement our presentation on a non gaap basis our adjusted net income which excludes the impact of stock based compensation investing of stock
based awards granted at the i p o was forty five point eight million for the second quarter assuming a normalized tax rate and one hundred and thirty nine point seven million fully converted
shares outstanding this equated to twenty four cents per share in adjusted eps our adjusted ebitda which again excludes the impact of stock based compensation was sixty five point eight million for
the quarter with a corresponding margin of sixty three percent let me touch on adjusted net trading income we spent time last quarter outlining the circumstances around unallocated bucket as you will
note this quarter's unallocated amount is lower the unallocated amount results from a difference in how we report us gaap results for trading income and how we track and allocate those results
among the various categories internally as an illustration if we make markets in equity security listed on a european exchange and we also make markets in an a d r tied to that european
security this could result in an al oak unallocated amount the reason is that the markets in europe close eleven thirty am eastern time from eleven thirty eastern time until the markets close in the us at
four pm easter time we will continue to make markets in the a d r for financial statement purposes we will us the settlement prices in new york at four pm however because the
underlying security on the european exchange naturally did not trade between eleven thirty am and four pm eastern for gaap purposes it may appear as if we had a trading gain or loss
however because we are always hedged in reality there is not gain or loss on the expense side we focus on communications and data processing employee compensation and overhead as our key core
expenses i'll touch on all three here for communications and data processing year to date twenty sixteen versus year to date twenty fifteen we are up one half
of one percent this essentially flat expense growth in the key technology expense line item is a result of our overall aggressive cost management and deployment of scale across our markets similarly
similarly our operations and administrative expenses are down meaningfully year to date turning to our compensation accrual 's for the second quarter our employee compensation expense is twenty point eight million excluding the impact
of non cash amortization of options grants granted and valued at the time of the i p o gaap compensation expense for the quarter is nineteen point three million including stock based comp this is
eighteen point four percent of net revenues excluding stock based comp this is fourteen point three percent of net revenues for the full year twenty fifteen these figures are sixteen
point one percent and thirteen point one percent respectively we will continue to manage our comp our expenses aggressively including our compensation ratio in appropriate response to market conditions while continuing to attract and
retain the most talented employees as mentioned earlier our board of directors has authorized the distribution of twenty four cents per share payable september fifteenth to shareholders of record of september first
looking back over the past five quarters since our i p o our pay out ratio based on adjusted eps is eighty one percent consistent with our promise to target a seventy to
one hundred percent payout ratio at i p o finally looking at our company as a fully taxed c corp with all the shares converted to the public company our fully taxed adjusted net
income for the quarter would have been thirty two point nine million or twenty four cents per share assuming a hundred and thirty nine point seven million shares outstanding now i will
turn the call back to the moderator to begin the q and a part
thank you ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press star then one on your touch tone telephone if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press the pound key our first question today comes from the line of rich rep et oh with sandler o'neil your line is open
as i said in my remarks we're really very humbled to be doing business with a global bank like j p morgan it's truly a great reflection on the firm
our eight year plus relationship with j p morgan they were there at the beginning of the formation of the firm and uh were a key business partner for the firm for many many years
capabilities and understanding of market structure um you know we we gave them some in depth analysis of how the equities market worked and you know basic stuff that we do at virt virtue around market structure that compelled
them to a further discussion of how our technology works and this was this was a very long uh due diligence period i guess i'll call it of over six months uh we began a proof
of concept to see you know how we would route their uh uh treasury market orders and you know could we be compelling and more efficient and what not and so it's not like we're both flying in
to this blind i mean there's been a long detailed review of our technology and how it would work with their trading dna and really the most significant thing
how they want to get more nimble and and leaner in terms of how they access the market and hopefully we can be their valued partner in a lot of asset classes where
over here at virtue and we really opened up the kimono to show them how we operate and and what not so we're very very optimistic here at virtue that this is going to
i know the investment didn't close until july but how you did in the second quarter uh verse versus this investment
we've been a market maker on japan next since its founding we owned a small piece of equity which we earned effectively through an equity
jump all over japan next and we are very very big supporters of their senior management team there there's a fellow by name of chuck chon who runs it he's a really high quality
executive we're connected to hundreds of venues around the world and i would put chuck in the upper you know uh decile of people or folks that we interact and so we we've worked them
on a variety of different initiatives throughout the years and this was again much like the j p morgan relationship we've built trust with them and they were impressed i guess with the services
we provided in our market share and how we're trying to make the markets better and more efficient there and how we interact with the regulators and so therefore they invite us
it's a meaningful platform there are certain regulatory uh initiatives that they're pursuing around margins financing for equities trading that could be very very significant and so we viewed it as a
very important strategic relationship in a very significant market place in the world and you know the largest market place that we access in asia so uh we're very optimistic that it will both be rewarding
financial investment because this is a great platform but also a very key strategic initiative as they try to evolve that market place both on the equity and then future side
be x or it's going y it's going to z i know that's going to be a challenge for you all in terms of how you value the relationship obviously i look at
this more in the medium to long term this is rep you know continuing the theme alex that large financial institutions whether they be big buy side institutions that are looking for more efficient
ways to route their equity orders to the market place both here and in europe and large sell side institutions that are looking for more efficient cost effective ways to access market places
we're starting in u s treasuries and again we're optimistic that hopefully we can you know expand this to other asset classes they are coming to a financial technology firm like virtue that has the advantage of having
great financial technology but also being a very active participant in the market place we understand market structure so we're not a financial tools technology company we don't have
we don't have algos that we sell we really want to partner with these institutions that have to access the market in a more efficient way so we see a real evolution
and confluence if you will of two sides of the market place that need to come together and cooperate in order to access the market so you know again i apologize i can't give you a
definitive it's going to x or y or z but i think medium to longer term and in the short term this is a very significant important strategic initiative for our firm
our adjusted ebitda margins they fluctuate but they're you know they start with a six in front of them and my goal as a ceo is always to maintain that so yeah
there's certainly going to be a question of scale um you know for our agency execution business you know uh you all know steve ka vole e joined us about a year ago from morgan stanley not just for that
role but for other roles but other than that we haven't added any incremental personnel we are using our existing technology or existing algorithms what really has become apparent to us
is as i just you know said two minutes ago we are a great financial technology firm that really understands market structure right and so we have these great assets that we think we can
leverage and scale without adding incremental cost i'm not a believer in managing sales forces not if there's wrong in that i didn't you know start this firm with vinnie to
understand it's a premium product and are willing to pay for it so uh you know we we're entering this strategic with j p morgan and might there be other institutions that we partner with down the road
absolutely we're open to that um you know we've had some preliminary discussions with other financial institutions not surprisingly about seeing along these lines because look the world is getting more efficient it's not getting
two hundred and thirty six markets in thirty six countries and twelve thousand financial instruments and we do it with a one hundred and fifty people because that's the advantage that we
have we recognize that scalability automation and using technology was our advantage not a market structure advantage we are not smarter than anybody we're not faster than anybody but we can scale and
use technology in a way that's very efficient access to market i think that that is compelling to people and we're going to pick and choose our partners uh the right way to
not what we're going to do i'm not going to change the whole nature of this firm for that purpose but we think alex that this is a way to grow our business
having the same kind of opportunities to engage in the market that you had previously i know you probably don't see a lot of other competitors in the market either but
but it's been consistent it'll go up and down and sometimes you'll have a you know an e t f that will do a reverse stock split so instead of trading fifty million shares a day all
of a sudden its trading five million shares a day and you can track your market share goes down because you're a big market maker in that e t f so you have things
like that that makes sense but we're obviously very very on it in terms of fx it's a little more difficult obviously as you know because it's not some central repository that
opportunity ie a lot of banks have gone from being principal market makers to more agency or market centers so we can make markets for them there's been new opportunities in n d f's
so it's really particularly in currencies which i think was your question there's multiple markets and market overall market share it's not like u s equities you can say ok well we got
x percent single double digit market share in overall fx you really have to look at it pair by platform pair and in some instances e c n or platform by platform
they you know pull back from the market place you have days that are lot quitter where our market share might be a little uh lower than a than a breaks it type of day because there are
more more participants but overall i'm very bullish about that business i continue to think how that's going to be a growth area for us um you know unfortunately in fx and in these other categories
we need the market place cooperate and if you pro forma it out uh you know the breaks it period it was really a very low volume and and very muted volatility period which as i mentioned
in my prepared remarks is not ideal for a market maker but i think we performed very well given the market opportunities
our next question comes from the line of william katz with citigroup your line is open
and we said we may actually have something here and the counter party we were interacting with you know was giving us positive feedback so kind of went quote unquote live if you will during the second
quarter and got great feedback from the you know institution that we're working with uh very very smart guy that helped us understand that market better uh in a way that we thought made the service
you know we got a lot of inbound calls and we've developed a queue or a backlog if you will of buy side institutions that have gone through uh you know credit and compliance and
only have one chance to make a first impression and we really didn't want to make a bad first impression and so we have a list here internally of half a dozen institutions
we've tweaked somewhat to deal with uh a different type of market and more importantly also i should have mentioned earlier we've got great analytical tools here at virtue that we developed
over the last eight years in order to enable us to access the market we're making those tools available you know to these buy side institutions as well so we're providing them with
great execution great analytical tools and i think most important see real transparency in market structure understanding that's what is the most compelling thing to them so i think it's the product
a service offering that uh ultimately will be very compelling to people
that's very helpful and then just maybe a follow up i may have a two part question i apologize two little things in there
the year or fifteen as more of a guide post as we think about the second half of the year
our friend it's really the measure of what market place participants are willing to pay for our services our liquidity and when it declines um the bid offer spread which is obviously the capture
are we focused on it yes am i concerned about it in the you know medium to long term absolutely not our business continues to be robust our market share continues to be there but
trading income that we historically have joe you want to answer that
net compensation number and then i compare that to net revenues which we which we look at that as the our adjusted net trading income plus the technology services uh so if you look at that
for the full year twenty fifteen uh the ratio including stock based comps so fully loaded was sixteen point one percent uh if you take out stock based comp
it was thirteen point one percent point year to date we're running at uh eighteen point one percent including stock based comp and thirteen point seven percent excluding stock based comp
can you just help us understand what the impact of an appreciating dollar is on the business um it feels like um some of the impact here it manifests itself
through the capture rate but just wanted to get a sense of when we look at everything in revenues and expenses how should we be thinking about that going forward
categories that are hedged against each other uh that it's not going to be something that you're going really be able to reliably forecast
ashley it's a very good question right because as joe mentioned we're in so many different countries so it can be headwind it can be tailwind you know uh like the good example is like
the canadian and uh aussie dollars have you know declined significantly i i don't remember the exact numbers and what not over the last two or three years so a canadian penny and an aussie penny if
you will is worth less than us dollar terms today than it was worth four years ago but that's still the bid offer increments in each of those market places
results on a notional basis us dollar adjusted basis you know uh have actually improved but the notional amount 's gone down because the australian dollar has declined so severely and the same thing in canada
with regards to our americas equity segment and obviously that could cut the other way depending upon what's happening with the us dollar relative to these other currencies it's one of the
p and l i don't panic if it's gone from x to you know ten percent less when the currency is gone down thirty percent i'd say on a relative basis we are actually capturing more
that's a very very interesting question as well i thought a lot about that i mean just to be very clear we are not providing anybody uh on a permanent our secret source or
our technology right like obviously on the buy side institutions have the ability to us our algorithms but they don't have access to the code if you will and we obviously traders
here that are monitoring the orders and what not so uh but look on that side and then on the experience we've had with you know j p morgan thus far in the proof of concept
learning a lot just on how these institutions look at these markets obviously big buy side institutions that are making directional investments in stocks in large quantities look at the market place
very very differently than virtue financial does that's the power of the marriage if you will because we look at the market on a micro market structure tick by tick micro market micro second
micro second basis maybe u s treasuries is slightly different right because it's not really a micro second uh market place all the time but certainly and these institutions look at the market very
differently so that's the incremental benefit the knock on affect if you will of partnering with these great institutions that can add a lot of value and dna to what we do
and does that have application around you know uh the rest of our firm of course it does obviously cognizant of our contractual and confidentiality concerns and all that kind of stuff and we keep
the order flow from the buy side institutions you know separate in a separate you know broker dealer and all that so we're cognizant that we want to be the non conflicted you know broker that that that doesn't that isn't looking
for any incremental business we're obviously not an i p o calendar research kind of uh uh broker we're really purely about execution in a non conflicted very very efficient cost effective manner and we think
that that's what the the firm can offer to these large institutions so thematically and as i've talked about on that call that's you know we think an important uh component of how we're going to grow
this firm long term
our next question comes from the line of ken worthington with j p morgan your line is open
um one of the things that virtue highlighted on its i p o was that it didn't have any customers and that meant really no obligations and and lower risk um a number of the initiatives that
you've been uh working on are are really about servicing client so with that in mind how do we think about how this changes the risk profile of the firm
this in a nice way uh the managing a sales force and keeping our headcount down and not changing the dna of the firm and in answer to a prior question i made
uh you know when you're executing on some ones' behalf right you've got responsibilities to that person and you know you can averages and all kind of stuff and i think we talked about that in context
loss you know we're not getting in to the payment of order flow we're not doing retail execution we're going to have a handful of of buy side institutions that are sending us these discrete
orders i think that's manageable from a risk perspective i'm very very focused obviously on maintaining our margins and being very efficient around the firm and as i've said a number
times on this phone call and i've said internally and we've uh you know shown by our actions thus far we're not going to change the headcount of the firm in a meaningful way or
then in in terms of the j p morgan relationship and may be other relationships like this how do you go about charging for it is it is it subscription based is it is it volume based
just it's a very significant subscription model uh but it's a subscription model uh the partnership with j p morgan is going to be more of a hybrid
where there's going to be an element of a subscription fee if you will to to offset you know the fact that we've spent a lot of time and money over the last eight years
take both forms it can hybrid like this one it could be pure trading it could be pure uh you know subscription base we're obviously in this business you know and willing to partner with folks
because we want to make it a win win situation we want to make money and we want to make sure that the counter party that we're interacting with feel good about the relationship
is making a bunch of money i think in this particular instance not to speak for uh that wonderful institution that you work for but i think they uh you know they probably wanted us to have
some skin in the game a significant amount of skin in the game and you know the more money that these this venture it's not a separate legal entity but this partnership if you will
this phone call we view this as a very important strategic focus of this firm uh going forward so i i think the model is you know could be a mix of both and ken as we
thank you and that does conclude today's q and a portion of the call i'd like to turn the call back over to virtues ceo douglas see fu for any closing remarks
thank you operator and thank you everybody for participating today um we know we went a long time here but we felt like we had a lot of strategic initiatives in particularly j p morgan
ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference this does conclude today's program you may all disconnect everyone have a great day
operator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the wells fargo first quarter earnings conference call all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question during this time simply press star and the number one on your telephone keypad if you would like to withdraw your question press the pound key
i would now like to turn the call over to jim rowe director of investor relations mister rowe you may begin your conference thank you regina and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call today where our chairman and c e o john stumpf and our c f o john shrew berry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions this call is being recorded before we get started i would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wells fargo dot
com i would also like to caution you that we may make forward looking statements during todays call that are subject to risks and uncertainties factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our s e c filings including the form eight k filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement information about any non g a a p financial measures referenced including the reconciliation of those measures to g a a p measures can also be found in our s e c filings
in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website i will now turn the call over to our chairman and c e o john stumpf thank you jim good morning and thank you for joining us today our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers financial needs while the persistent low rate environment market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas
industry provided some near term headwinds our long term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy for example we are the largest lender in the us and our loan and deposit balances are at an all time high we continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and february
was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years we worked to make every relationship new and existing a lasting one and our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized with wells fargo ranking number one in customer loyalty among large banks in the two thousand and sixteen customer loyalty engagement index
conducted by the firm brand keys let me now highlight our results in the first quarter we generated earnings of five point five billion dollars and an e p s of ninety nine cents we grew revenue compared with a year ago by four percent with growth in both the net interest income and non interest income
and our pretax pre provision profit grew five percent average loans grew sixty four billion dollars or seven percent from a year ago our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up forty four point six billion dollars or four percent from a year ago
and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by five percent while deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a two hundred million dollars reserve build the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge off rate remaining near historical lows at thirty eight basis points annualized
reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from g e capital and we returned three billion dollars to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter
as you know yesterday the federal reserve and f d i c announced their response to the two thousand and fifteen resolution plan submitted by eight banks including wells fargo while we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our two thousand and sixteen
submission turning to the economic environment while signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets the u s economy which is the primary driver of wells fargo s results continues to be resilient for example while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry the us is still a net
energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses job creation in the u s remains robust with two point seven million jobs added over the past year alone consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowing
in fact servicing financial obligations require just fifteen percent of household income at the start of the year more than a percentage point lower than the long term average and several percentage points lower than what the recession level was in late two thousand and seven
the housing market continues to do well with steady gains in sales construction and prices this improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge offs were down forty one percent from a year ago commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment industrial and retail sectors
and our c r e portfolio continued to generate net recoveries so while the start of two thousand and sixteen has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success namely increasing customers loans deposits and building capital this unwavering focus
on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities john shrew berry our chief financial officer will now provide more details on our first quarter results john thanks john and good morning everyone my comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page two john and i will then answer your questions we had another quarter of solid results we have now generated
quarterly earnings of more than five billion dollars for fourteen consecutive quarters one of only two companies in the country to do so demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline while earnings declined from a year ago our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of three hundred and fifty nine million dollars or seven cents per share
and a one hundred million dollars dollar reserve release our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a three hundred and eighty one million dollar gain recorded in all other non interest income all other income also included three hundred and seventy nine million dollars of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates
and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter we would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship but the impact in every quarter will vary we had a one hundred and twenty four million dollars of other than temporary impairment o t t i in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter the deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the two hundred million dollar
credit reserve build in the quarter also i will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call expenses included seven hundred and fifty two million dollars of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and four o one k matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement eligible team members our first quarter results also included
the g e capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter on page four we show the strong year over year growth john highlighted including increases in revenue pretax pre provision profit loans and deposits turning to page five let me highlight a few balance sheet trends investment securities declined twelve point seven billion dollars from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility
in the bond market we had five billion dollars of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last years average of twenty six billion dollars per quarter long term debt increased twenty eight point four billion dollars with twenty three point eight billion dollars of issuances including eleven billion dollars raised in advance of closing the g e capital acquisitions we also assumed three point six billion
dollars of debt from previous g e capital securitizations short term investments and fed funds sold increased thirty point four billion dollars reflecting growth in deposits long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter turning to the income statement overview on page six revenue increased six hundred and nine million dollars from the fourth quarter with growth in
both net interest and non interest income i will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call as shown on page seven we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter up ten percent from a year ago and three percent from the fourth quarter commercial loans grew thirty one point six billion dollars from the fourth quarter including twenty four point nine
billion dollars from the g e capital acquisitions and broad based organic growth consumer loans declined nine hundred and twenty three million dollars from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans auto and securities based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card
our total average loan yield increased eight basis points from the fourth quarter reflecting the g e capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing we added a total of thirty point eight billion dollars of loans and leases from the g e capital acquisitions the benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high
quality businesses including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships this is our largest acquisition since two thousand eight the integration is on track and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in two thousand sixteen we completed the g e railcar services acquisition on january first which included nine hundred and eighteen million dollars of loans and interest earning leases and three point two billion dollars of operating leases
reported in other assets most of the revenue from this business is reflected in non interest income as lease income on march first we acquired the north american based portion of g e capital c and i loans and leases which included twenty four billion dollars of loans and interest earning leases and two point seven billion dollars of operating leases the remaining two billion dollars of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year the loans and leases we acquired were
were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so that there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions slide nine highlights our broad based loan growth c and i loans were up fifty point five billion dollars or nineteen percent from a year ago driven by the g e capital acquisitions
and broad based organic growth core one to four family first mortgage loans grew seventeen point three billion dollars or eight percent from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non conforming mortgage loans commercial real estate loans grew fifteen point eight billion dollars or twelve percent from a year ago benefiting from the second quarter g e capital acquisition and organic growth auto loans were up four point three billion dollars or eight percent from last year
we have consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing credit card balances were up three point one billion dollars or ten percent from a year ago reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts other revolving credit and installment loans were up two point seven billion dollars or eight percent from a year ago with
growth in securities based lending personal lines and loans and student loans as highlighted on page ten we had one point two trillion dollars of average deposits in the first quarter up forty four point six billion dollars or four percent from a year ago our average deposit cost was ten basis points up one basis point from a year ago and up two basis points from the fourth quarter the slight
increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some wholesale banking customers we continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain page eleven highlights our revenue diversification our revenue continued to
be relatively balanced between net interest and non interest income we grew net interest income seventy nine million dollars from the fourth quarter reflecting growth in earning assets including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from g e capital the benefit from higher short term rates and disciplined deposit pricing these increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources including periodic
dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter the net interest margin declined two basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income all other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the n i m we grew net interest income in the first quarter by six percent from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full year basis in two thousand and sixteen compared with two thousand
fifteen even if there are no additional rate increases total non interest income increased five hundred thirty million dollars from fourth quarter driven by the increase in all other non interest income that i highlighted at the start of the call the non interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the g e capital acquisitions we completed
in the quarter which also included related lease depreciation expense the linked quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our markets businesses the volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees which declined a hundred and twenty six million dollars from the fourth quarter we also had lower debt and equity investment gains down two hundred and eighty one million dollars from the fourth quarter
while linked quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality both of these fees grew eight percent from a year ago driven by account growth mortgage banking revenue declined sixty two million dollars from the fourth quarter origination volume was forty four billion down six percent from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up
thirteen percent from a year ago reflecting a stronger housing market applications were up twenty percent from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with a thirty nine billion dollars application pipeline up thirty four percent from the fourth quarter we expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was one hundred and sixty eight basis points
in the first quarter down fifteen basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the first quarter releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined one hundred and seven million dollars from fourth quarter which also contributed to lower production revenue servicing income increased one hundred and twenty million dollars from fourth quarter from higher net m s r
servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs as shown on page fourteen expenses increased four hundred and twenty nine million dollars from fourth quarter as i highlighted at the start of the call the increase was primarily driven by seven hundred and fifty two million dollars of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter while we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter there are certain expenses that will increase including salary
expense reflecting annual merit increases which became effective late in the first quarter and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising costs which are also expected to increase we had four hundred and fifty four million dollars of operating losses primarily driven by litigation expense in the
first quarter now that the f d i c has issued their final rule i want to update you on the expected impact of the f d i c surcharge that i mentioned on our call last quarter which is lower than we previously expected we currently estimate that the surcharge along with a previously approved base rate reduction will increase our total f d i c assessment by approximately one hundred million dollars per
quarter starting in the third quarter of two thousand sixteen our efficiency ratio was fifty eight point seven percent in the first quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of fifty five percent to fifty nine percent for the full year two thousand sixteen turning to our business segments starting on page fifteen community banking earned three point three billion dollars in the first quarter down seven percent
from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of two thousand and fifteen and up four percent from the fourth quarter we continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up five percent from a year ago this growth along with increased usage and new product offerings benefited our
debit and credit card businesses debit card purchase volume was seventy two point four billion dollars in the first quarter up nine percent from a year ago and credit card purchase volume was seventeen point five billion dollars up thirteen percent from a year ago customers are increasingly using our award winning digital offerings with digital active customers
up six percent from a year ago including seventeen point seven million mobile active users with continued double digit growth in mobile adoption wholesale banking earned one point nine billion dollars in the first quarter down three percent from a year ago and down nine percent from the fourth quarter the decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio
revenue grew six percent from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non interest income this growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the g e capital acquisitions investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance
loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad based organic growth with average loans up forty nine point eight billion dollars or thirteen percent from a year ago the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit year over year growth average deposit balances declined three point seven billion dollars from a year ago reflecting lower international deposits from market
volatility and the competitive rate environment wealth and investment management earned five hundred and twelve million dollars in the first quarter down three percent from a year ago down fourteen percent from the fourth quarter year over year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up fourteen percent offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income the
decline in linked quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up eight percent from a year ago and loans up thirteen percent the eleventh consecutive quarter of double digit year over year loan growth with continued growth in nonconforming mortgage loans and securities based
lending we successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisers pursuant to our agreement with credit suisse we were able to recruit substantially all of the advisers that we targeted we are pleased with the success we have had recruiting these financial advisers and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management
turning to page eighteen credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only thirty eight basis points of annualized net charge offs net charge offs increased fifty five million dollars from the fourth quarter including an increase of eighty seven million dollars from our oil and gas portfolio while our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess
leverage in the industry the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well non performing assets increased seven hundred and six million dollars from the fourth quarter we had one point one billion dollars in higher oil and gas non accrual and three hundred and forty three million dollars in nonaccrual loan from the g e capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions these increases were partially offset by lower
residential and commercial real estate non accrual and lower foreclosed assets as i mentioned earlier we had a two hundred million dollars reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves since first quarter two thousand and fifteen we have released one point eight billion dollars of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing one point four
billion dollars of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio the total allowance now stands at twelve point seven billion slide nineteen highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio which is less than two percent of total loans
outstanding we had seventeen point eight billion dollars of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter up four hundred and seventy four million dollars from the fourth quarter including two hundred and thirty six million dollars in loans acquired from g e capital the remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines primarily in the e and p sector the composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable with fifty five percent of our
outstanding s to the e and p sector twenty one percent to midstream and twenty four percent to service companies approximately seven percent or one point two billion dollars of our outstanding s are to investment grade companies based on public ratings however there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans our loans are primarily to middle market companies
that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles of the approximately one hundred bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of two thousand and fifteen only eleven of our borrowers have filed during that time our outstanding s also included eight hundred and nineteen million dollars of second lien and three hundred and seventy four million dollars of
mezzanine loans our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down one point three billion dollars or three percent from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors this decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities in part from spring re determination s and net charge offs approximately thirty four percent of our unfunded commitments were to investment grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower
in addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio we also had a total of two point four billion dollars in our securities portfolio slide twenty highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we work through this cycle the sectors performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively
have impacted loan quality in addition to low oil and gas prices cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by reduced production run off of hedges and limited additional cost levers reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers financial condition as a result of these factors we had two hundred and four million dollars of net charge offs in the first quarter there were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter non accrual loans were one point nine billion dollars
we reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis and placed loans on non accrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate approximately ninety percent of the non accrual is recurrent on interest and principal payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal which decreases future losses
substantially all of our non accrual loans are senior secured given the conditions in the industry criticized loans which include non accrual loans increased fifty seven percent of the portfolio reflecting continued downward credit migration this migration reflects changes in the borrowers financial condition reflecting the downward credit migration our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased five hundred four million
dollars to one point seven billion this portion of the allowance was nine point three percent of total oil and gas loans outstanding but as i have noted before the entire twelve point seven billion dollars allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio turning to slide twenty one in addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas
industry may impact performance as we manage through this cycle for example we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring fifteen regions in eight states where greater than three percent of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in houston and alaska neither of which have three percent of employment directly tied to oil production we are tracking changes in outstanding s utilization delinquency rates fico scores and l t v migration across our consumer
portfolios in these regions and having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years consumer delinquencies in oil dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non oil concentrated communities we currently anticipate further deterioration and while we remain committed to serving our customers
we have tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil dependent regions were also actively monitoring commercial real estate exposure on a loan by loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry our c r e and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities
our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements in summary we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we are working closely with all impacted customers we have increased the size of our workout team and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures
we have started the spring re determination s and are decreasing borrowing bases we are proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly while the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial
to our overall performance turning to page twenty two our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity tier one ratio fully phased in at ten point six percent in the first quarter well above the regulatory minimum buffers and our internal buffer our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from g e while continuing to return capital to our shareholders we issued thirty five point five
million common shares in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity but we still reduced our common shares outstanding by sixteen point two million shares through share repurchases of fifty one point seven million our net payout ratio was sixty percent in the first quarter in summary our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included
some near term headwinds our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth including adding customers loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position we look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our investor day on may twenty four john and i will now answer your questions and this time i would like to remind everyone to ask
press star and the number one on your telephone keypad our first question will come from the line of ken ousting with jefferies please go ahead thanks good morning guys how are you on the reserving and energy question thanks for the color john
so it seems like you had a little bit more of the acceleration we have seen so far of those who have reported as far as the actual losses and the reserve build as well how do we just get the understanding from here of the kind of pace of potential reserve additions and then underneath that are we effectively at the point where many benefits from
lingering consumer reserve have kind of moved past thanks well on the second part of your question it is tough to say now we are analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there is continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular it is certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of whats happening on the oil and
gas side that has been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while housing housing has been strong and that does not feel likely to reverse course right now but again we only know at the end of the quarter with respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year we are constantly reassessing borrower quality
were doing a semi annual borrowing base redetermination on e and p loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now call it twenty twenty five percent have been completed so well have the rest of that information thats name by name capital structure by capital structure so that will continue to inform things and we have definitely taken
steps or for example categorize loans as non performing even if we have not completed their spring redetermination but my sense is there is more information there so this is going to go on for a while we are in the forty dollar context today we were in the thirties for a while some of these capital structures just need to be restructured that will take some time and
my assumption is that were going to be talking about this all year i do not know that we will continue to reserve at this pace all year because we feel great about a reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know but i would be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter or this was the quarter things will unfold as they are going to unfold depending on what happens with prices both spot and forward and the pace of
restructurings of services and e and p companies ken to remind you that i mentioned that residential real estate losses were down forty one percent year over year and i think that sometimes goes a bit unnoticed when we went into the downturn we had over a hundred billion dollars of pick a pay loans and over a hundred billion dollars
of home equity loans and those were the two toughest residential portfolios today those portfolios are less than half of what we started with and the performance is really really good so there is a lot of momentum on that side that has been that has happened
over the last few years but especially in the last year or two that is a fair point john thanks for that and just one follow up john the re determination s and the structuring john how far ahead can you get a redetermination i get your point that were only twenty five percent through the spring but have you already been able to get ahead of that just in terms of anticipation or you can only make those adjustments when we get there and then also with the price back up
do we go into spring redetermination using a forty dollar plus starting point or do you still end up being much more punitive in terms of how you discount and how you redetermine yeah i think that the price tag for this cycle is the front month is more in the mid thirties context and its a curve that we are using not just the spot price but it is probably twenty percent
lower across our price deck curve in the spring versus where we were six months ago and believe me that is not the only item that impacts the outcome its what has been going on with incremental exploration what are the reserves in terms of quantity and a variety of other things but in terms of getting in front of it as i said were categorizing loans as non performing
we are recognizing loss you know these loss determinations the two hundred million dollars that we have taken that is our own credit folks determining that there is that there is something to be done it is not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan and we can do that even before we have completed a redetermination so
from an impact to wells fargo point of view were always trying to stay out in front of it thanks for all that your next question comes from oil and gas questions your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with bernstein please go ahead hi i will switch it up in terms of net interest income john how much have you benefited from the december hike
in the first quarter have all the variable loans repriced and will there be additional pull through benefit from that december hike into the second quarter so our estimation is that we have gotten the full benefit of the december rate hike the benefit on the asset side the cost on the liability side we talked about the impact on deposits which has been negligible
and so i think thats in the run rate at this point okay and then question for john stumpf whats the market like john for additional portfolio purchases that is part one and then part two is in terms of broader m and a because of your size and favored nation status youre the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on m and a for big
financial companies and since a lots changed around the environment the last few years can you just remind us your strategy around m and a maybe how its different than when you were smaller and how dodd frank and too big to fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward sure as you probably know and those who know us well ninety seven percent of the revenue we produce is from us based
customers consumers small business men and women middle market large customers and while we love our international business it is mostly in support of our us based businesses and we have leadership positions in most of the businesses in which we do and
we do not set out to be number one just to be number one we work really hard and if we do really we provide great products and services and great value we grow because of that there is a couple of areas where we are sub optimized that we are working hard to grow one of those i think the most attractive area would be the area that david carroll
runs in wealth investment management you heard me say a number of times where we have eleven percent of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here even though we have a powerful wonderful group of leaders and advisors across the geography we could still do a lot more business there is a lot of our
customers who call us their bank who have their wealth away so were working hard organically that business has been growing double digits if there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense terrific if there is not that is also terrific on the consumer side we have leadership
in terms of distribution of our online activity of our checking activity or debit activity but not a credit card activity even though we have grown that significantly internally about over forty three percent of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card but that is an area that that would be opportunistic we have been doing a great job organically if there would be some opportunities
along the line that would make sense we would surely consider that but i would think of it this way john i would think of it that we have all that we need right now and if something became available that we thought would be a bolt on that would help us in those areas specifically but other areas generally sure we would look at that but that is our focus right now our best
opportunity to grow long term shareholder values here value creation is doing more or just doing it better okay thank you your next question comes from the line of paul miller with f b r and company please go ahead yeah thank you very much a lot of clients a lot of questions that i have been getting is that yeah energy a lot of people might be reserved good for energy
but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two and since energy is starting to struggle that the economy got in a recession i know you have heard of it but what are you seeing on the second and third derivatives on the credit book are you seeing any real deterioration in c r e markets in some of these areas like texas
where probably energy hitting the hardest sure well as i mentioned in the prepared remarks in the consumer portfolios all of them were growing m s a by m s a and comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy that the greater
than three percent employment is one measure that we use but we have also included houston for example to your point about texas being hard hit even though it does not qualify with the three percent employment trigger and what we have discovered is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time no surprise because that is where all the growth has been coming from and they are starting to look more average so whether its measures of delinquency
in some cases measures of l t v based on whats changing in asset values they look a little bit more average so it does not feel like it is a at least at this point that it is another shoe to drop in the short term but as you expect less employment people will loans will perform differently in commercial real estate which is where we have a big
presence we have recently done a deep dive in texas in particular and office vacancies are somewhat higher in the houston area no surprise i think about twenty percent including sublease space multifamily is a little bit weaker and so were looking at that first and foremost frankly with respect to what it means to our risk to our
own portfolio and we feel fine about what our exposures are there but those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with so when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures than that that probably is the first second order outcome what people are going to have to look out for more broadly speaking i think we still feel
were in a two percent environment there are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas we are in the same low growth better consumer strong employment environment that we have been operating in for a couple of years not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like were stalling either paul if i can just give you an anecdotal
i lived in texas for six years in the mid to late nineties so twenty years ago and there was a period of time there there was volatility in the oil and gas space and there was some challenges and i have been back i was just in houston last week and i have been back a number of times in the last year and things do feel
different twenty years later it is a much more diverse economy and if you take texas generally but houston specifically and it feels different this time around downturns are always heard volatile markets always have an impact but this feels different this time because of what the state has done
to diversify their economy hey guys thank you very much your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead hi good morning so my first question is actually a follow up to johns question my conversations with investors have often paired well just to be frank with either
large credit card companies or there is clearly the rumor for you know wells potentially buying a large investment bank which you formally denied as we think about what you were saying john about looking at bolt on opportunities should we think about the deal size as sizes that are manageable enough that maybe sort of the real stop here is wells fargo not moving up the safi surcharge as we think
about the opportunity for non organic growth should we think about sort of the hard stop in terms of size being that you would like to keep your safi surcharge where it is today erika here is how i think about it i think about wells fargo as an organic growth company we have i have been here almost
thirty five years and i have probably been involved in if there is two hundred and fifty acquisitions we have done with all different companies as we come to the modern wells fargo i have probably been involved in half of those just because it happened during my career time and they are hard to do there is a lot of
work in those things and we now have a company that is the best company i have ever worked for the strongest brand the best people the furthest reach the deepest relationship the long enduring customer thing so and we are very very careful buyers
and i see us as a lot of opportunity to grow as i said organically if something and what we have done in the last four or five years have been largely bolt on i would say on i would say g e was a bigger a little bigger bolt on but those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders
after all this is your money our investors money that we are the stew is up so you know it would be out of character for us to do something you know that would be have a high degree of risk and a low
degree of shareholder reward on it that is just not who we are thanks you john that was very clear my second question is looking to capital change you know since even c car participants it seems like your job learning volatility is the least amount your the large peers you know as we look forward obviously you cant tell us about this year 's c car submission but as you look
forward how are you feeling about potentially continuing to push on that thirty percent dividends implicit dividends ceiling yeah it 's hard to comment on that during the middle of the c car sequel but i admire you for asking i try thanks for taking my questions yeah
the next question comes from the line of matt o connor with georgia bank please go ahead good morning good morning matt i just want to delve into a couple of potential owning records john ford and i guess the first one would be as you think about the liquidity that felt since you chose not to reinvest as much in his securities book you know how are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward you know there is not really any signs that you know raise
that arise materially so you think about market rates obviously off the bottom but what is your approach to managing that liquidity from here so it will it will be informed but week by week quarter by quarter as we as we assess the likelihood of increases in both short and
consequently at long term rates we will not sit idly on continues increases in cash forever we are going to have to we are going to have to put some of it to work we are very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future but subsequently rate rise does occur that is obviously a big issue for us and
and we like to be smart about it about entry points but you know if we are going to hover in the one seventies just to pick a number on the ten year and with mortgage rates where they are then there will be some amounts of re deployment we will probably talk about it a little bit more at investor day but it was really that a abrupt market volatility that happened after the first of the year that caused us to say let 's take
to pause here and figure out where this is going to settle out and it 's happened to settle out not much above above the low points at least again on the ten year from january early february but that is very clever when it has to be re deploy and then just separately on the expenses maybe just talk about is there any kind of change or even tweak on the approach to expense management
our active or maybe weaker revenues and you know some of the ongoing you know pressures and energies likely on going there is a continuous drum beat and a high level of vigilance around how we spend all of our business as usual applies for dollars or if we are constantly trying to find levers and in ways to be more efficient to streamline to
to make things consistent which provided some examples of that in the past in certain areas there are at the same time we have talked about the investment that we are making in technology the investments that we are making in product capability the investments that we are making in risk management and compliance and being a better firm those are going to be elevated for some time and they have been for some time we are
we feel comfortable at our fifty to fifty nine percent range which is where we have guided that i dont need to remind you but that is a very attractive level for a firm of our size a lot we think we are pretty lean overall but it is because we take this seriously day in and day out looking for ways to be efficient
okay thank you very much thank you matt you are very welcome your next question comes from the line of vera cache with number please go a head thank you good morning of here borrowers who drew on their oil and gas lines this quarter was any notable deterioration in their credit profile it is just trying to understand the extent to which heightened the
degrees of financial stress as a factor you know leading your buyers to draw down their lines and although you mentioned that your current reserve reflects everything that you currently know today i was wondering how you are thinking about the probability that more and more of your unfunded exposure will eventually become funded as moved deeper into the credit cycle sure that is a good question and of course we we absolutely have to make estimates about what we think the exposure
thought would be for any borrower who has got a remaining unfunded commitment that is some that is how the process works in the quarter there were some of these what you might characterize as defensive draws that we observe not that many of them you can see the increase in the total outstanding s in oil and gas was by about four hundred million dollars and about half
commitment that is how the process works in the quarter there were some of these what you might characterize as defensive draws that we have observed not that many of them you can see the increase in the total outstanding s in oil and gas rose by about four hundred million dollars and about half of that was from frankly leases that we picked up from ge that have a credit mark in them incidentally so it really did not amount to that much but it is a phenomenon that we have seen that we have read about it is not having that big of an impact today but we do think that were capturing that risk as we assess what the appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in the space so when i guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded how does that transition from unfunded funded impact your allowance i guess i think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitment is lower than it is on funded commitments but just trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of shifting from one bucket to the other so in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our whether we consider a borrower relationship to be non performing or what status were marking at were imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure at default would be if it is meaning that it could be greater than the currently outstanding amount that is part of the loan by loan process analysis by analysis that we do when building it when rewriting loans every quarter and building up for the allowance so there is some estimation of what today is currently unfunded will become funded in the future thank you and if i can just ask a final follow up can you discuss the methodology underlying your energy reserve is it based more on the ability of borrowers to repay
that is for both funded and unfunded commitments in this case so when i guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded how does that transition from unfunded to funded impact your allowance i guess i think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitments is lower than it is on funded commitments but you know i was trying to understand the reserving in that
a mixture of shifting from one book into another sure so so in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our whether we consider a vulnerable relationship to be non performing or at what status we are marking it we are
we are imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure that default would be if meaning that it could be greater than the current outstanding amount you know that is part of the loan by loan process analysis by analysis that we do when building it when re rating loans every quarter and building up for the allowance so there is some estimation of what
that today is fairly unfunded will become funded in the future okay if i can just have a final follow up on can you describe it when that the methodology underlying your energy reserve is based more on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans through cash flow generation or is it more kind of relying on collateral coverage based on reserves in the ground you know there is some reports suggesting that
that regulators are less happier with collateral coverage and i was wondering if you could kind of speak to specifically to you know the approach that wells fargo has taken well it is a combination of both and they are highly correlated for e and p companies in particular but you know it 's deep it 's very sources of repayment both principle and interest in full and on time and we are taking into account there that our projections of their cash flows and we are taking into account of projections
of the value of collateral that we might have to get back liquidate in order to get paid back or that they might have to liquidate in order to pay us back conner lee thank you so much for taking my questions sure our next question comes from line of kevin rocker with piper jeffery please go ahead good morning thanks for taking my questions and i just want to switch gears here and look at your auto expenditure you obviously want to
largest auto lenders in the country and have grown that portfolio over roughly thirty percent over the last three years given what we have seen in the industry and some deterioration in the sub clime portfolios could you help us giving an understanding of you know what your expectations are through the rest of this year and in
two thousand seventeen given the state of the auto industry and how hot it has been over the last couple of years sure well we have been pretty public with the fact that we are going to hold our ground with respect to with what we think are our quality long terms
and all are profile and we have actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years and we were number one i think we are number two right now and we are big on buying the loans that we like at terms
that we think are a good risk for ward and we are passing on those that we do not some of the things this year are a little bit different right now i mean seasonally obviously we are in a better place in q one and q four just because it is that those loans behave that way collections are losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter
it is a little bit things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter but we are still from a risk adjusted basis well within the band to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy where we have always had an eye on the elevated level of the used car auction prices that mannheim index in particular is evidence that we point to it if to
to get sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down adding three percent length quarter two percent year over year so all things being equal we would expect sorority to be a little bit worse when weak progressions occur but having said that we are still not in a bad place we
we have allowed our marketing leading position to slip a little bit let other people buy the loans that do not make sense to us it is still a great business for us it has been for a long time we work very closely with dealers we have a big floor plan business we have a big commercial banking business with the dealership community and we are in this for the long haul one more thing i guess i
we have observed this because the abs market has been under pressure some of the probably most aggressive players of the sub prime space have a little bit of a funding challenge i think in this environment that may soften things up a bit those are like current observations
so just a follow up on that i mean are you seeing better risk adjusted returns in sub prime auto versus prime auto right now and are you growing the sub prime auto portfolio at a figurative rate no we have should have held the line from you know using our own approach to what a sub prime vow and what a sub prime deal is we have limited ourselves to it about ten
percent of our originations which is amounted to about ten percent of our outstanding s that we have considered to be sub prime there is often an opportunity to grow that if we wanted to we have chosen not to and we like the risk return that we get in and the way we chose to participate in that space it has performed very well it is priced for the risk and frankly it does not
compete directly with some of the specialty finance companies that are in that space they tend to be a little bit deeper and they are running a different business yeah thank you for taking my question phillip you are welcome your next question comes from the line of joe morton with r b c capital please go a head thank you good morning guys hey joe hey joe i guess first just a quick follow up on kim 's question at the out set just i was curious how much
see increased oil and gas reserving the provision this quarter can be attributed to the share national credit exam you know i would say very little and the exam came and went and i think it worked out fine i would not want a disagreements on how we rate loans and also the guidance around leverage levels etcetera was introduced and that
that did not have much of an impact either this is just either our folks using consistent methodology making determinations on when loans should be non performing when we should take loss with them okay that is very helpful thanks i guess the other question was just i wonder if you could talk a bit more about the on how the ge capital business integration is going and how you are feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue selling
energies and also just wondering if you could quantify the impact we may see in the second quarter from a full run rate of the expenses i like the first part of the question better but we are okay we are it is a big opportunity so this is early stages this is an important and big integration so it will take a full year to get where we need to go and to transition
all of the services away from ge and over to well fargo and get things running and i am happy to say that the early reports are that we are doing great with customers and team members who i think we imagine that there is a real opportunity with these customers these are businesses where ge has been an absolute leader
and they have done that with credit now we have got that credit capability and that credit wiling ness and the perfect business model for that but we also have all of the other wholesale banking products and services well management services etcetera to bring to bare on this client group so it will take a while to work with each relationship and find out what they are doing that might be done at wells fargo in addition
to their credit but my sense is that we will get great adoption over time and that is part of what makes it such a high value opportunity for wells fargo okay thanks so much okay the next question comes from the line of john penn carey with petty core i s i please go a head good morning hey john just to go a couple more questions on energy and then one on expenses on energy what percentage of that
one point two billion in second lien exposure that you provided is non performing do you have that yeah let me see a hundred and thirteen million dollars of the combined second lien in mezzanine in today
if categorized is non accrual okay all right and what is your energy criticized ration as of march thirty one i know last quarter it was thirty eight percent approximately yeah it is fifty seven percent now five seven five seven okay and that reflects the environment that we are in that reflects you know what 's going on with the chest of the borrower
first that is what that that migration is what leads us to provide more reserve okay and then through the twenty five percent of the spring re determination that you completed what did the average reduction in borrowing be well so i guess i could start by saying that fifty six
fifty two percent have actually had a reduction in the borrowing base a quarter had no change in the borrowing base and the balance actually had an increase in the borrowing base because of more reserves that were included in the borrowing base and without getting too specific on the amounts of the reserve for
people who had a reduction it was relatively significant and frankly reflected the curve that we are using today versus where we would have been a quarter ago got it got it okay and then lastly on the exempt side can you just give us a little more color onto the why the intent of comp increase as much as it did this
quarter particularly on the back drop of some of the revenue sure heaven sure yeah it is not really incentive comp so much it is think about fica resetting in the first quarter contributions to our forty on k and then for people who are retirement eligible who there is lots of people at wells fargo who get an annual
pull equity incentives as part of their pay for most people it vests over a few years and the impact bleeds in over the vesting period if you are already retirement eligible it all hits in the quarter that it is granted because it is immediately vested and that is why the first quarter has that extra impact
okay it is not it is not so much about you know commission and incentives are a piece of it but it just it reflects the actual business activity that is happening okay thank you yeah your next questions comes from a line of betsy gross it with morgan
stanley please go a head hi good morning hi good morning betsy a couple of questions one and i will get the energy one out of the way first so i think you mentioned twenty five percent of your loans went through the re determination process in the quarter is that right that is just where we happen to be today for the spring re determination and the rest are underway it is about twenty five oh okay it is a borrower a borrower analysis so
so as of the ones that finished during the quarter how much of inquisitive reserve was required is that you know is that what drove your reserve up what drives the reserve up is our categorization of the loan as generally speaking as non accrual or non performing meaning that
we think there is a chance that we will not get full and timely repayment of every dollar or principle and interest that can certainly come about in connection with the re determination but it can come about for other reasons as well just in terms of our review of the companies overall performance the value of their collateral and what their prospects are so is it but it is not really a linear but you can not really draw a line between the re determination and
and specifically in that change and reserves okay it could have some impact but not funding it most definitely it would definitely have an impact if we reduce somebody 's availability and if they were drawn above their availability and we actually had a you know a moment of reckoning where they had they have to write a check that will not accelerate that analysis because you will have they will have
something that they have to do right then and there they are not that many instances of that it is just that as we go through the rest of the seventy five percent of the re determination for the spring yeah that could drive some more exponential reserve requirement it could but i mean we are it could we recapture a lot of that in our general assessment in our risk rating before having the actual results of the re determination but it certainly could okay
and then just a question on rates and balance sheet so you brought down said fund that they had is that right actually well we are thirty billion dollars higher in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter because we are much active in the bond market and that was mostly because of
your view on rates and where you wanted to re invest yes so about twenty five just increased in rates today are you in a more asset sensitive position because of that yeah i think that is right true okay any sizing or
no but we are more asset sensitive as a result we also have more long term debt that go under in the quarter right which so it is a high it is a handful of things going on at the same time but at the margin we are probably a little bit more asset sensitive yeah okay and then on the redeployment you know into securities
i know you you know you might want to have a higher rate to redeploy into but is there a point where you say you know i wanted to but it has been one seven for you know for five six seven eight months whatever it is you know i am going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer duration paper i mean could you just give us a sense as to how you think about that yeah i thought that is that is the discussion that we are having it regularly in our
in our a l c o meetings with the board et cetera my sense is that in this low rate environment we would probably not go as far out in terms of duration so that we were taking less capital risk even though the dollar for dollar return would be a little bit lower but it is the tradeoff between
foregone earnings capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we are having to assess and we are doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they do not go there and so the long and the short of it is i do not think that we are going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter but we know were reassessing every day to make a determination on at what entry
at what point in the curve we are interested in putting on more duration risk okay got it thanks a lot yup thank you your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with c l s a hey mike hi how much did the g e acquisitions add to e p s
this quarter and what do you expect it to add for the rest of the year so we are not breaking out what it added during the quarter and what we are saying is we think it will be modestly accretive for the rest of the year and it is really is about what it costs to transition people technology premises et cetera throughout the remainder of the year we will update that as we move along
and we have got more information about how those costs are actually coming in and being spent but i will tell you that the average the average asset yield for those assets is reflects the same kind of loan mix that we have in wholesale banking in general and the expectation once it is once they are
once they are fully integrated and we have finished our process is that they will carry the same type of efficiency ratio as the average wholesale lending business actually mike in the first quarter it was a little bit of couple moving parts here we actually if you will pre funded you know the liability side meaning that we raised
debt to fund this and that was on the books at the start of the quarter and most of the loans only came on march one so there is a lot of stuff going on in the first quarter but there is one month can we saw one month worth of really revenue
if you will so three months of funding one month of revenues so you will see the full benefit in the second quarter i was just wondering if you could size that a little bit more well we are talking about thirty ish billion dollars worth of assets and the same type of loan yields that we have on average in wholesale which gets you to a revenue number what we are
not specifically breaking out is what the expense impact is until we understand what the full integration expenses are but you will see three three hundred fifty million dollars per quarter of n i i from the loans and leases themselves
and how much of that did you have in the first quarter the three three hundred fifty million well so as john said we had we had one month of the revenue side of it we had not quite three months worth of the funding cost because we weren not fully funded for those three months right but but more than one
months worth of funding costs how about that okay and then separately john did i hear you correctly you said benefits of falling oil prices offset the costs i think you said that at the start of the call yeah i since we are still a net importer of energy and what is interesting mike is that
much of that those savings at the consumer level have been saved if you will they have not yet been spent so not all the savings at the pump what consumers have done and that not you know exclusively but they are saving more of that what is happening at the pump as opposed to spending it
okay and how do you see that in other words when oil prices go down the stock market declines bank stocks sell off and you are saying the market is wrong with that what do you see in your business that you think maybe the market has wrong how they think about oil prices it is i do not i have long
stopped you know trying to figure out the market and why bank stocks seem or stocks generally seem to move in concert with with commodity prices especially oil prices but be that as it may the consumer you know much of this economy sixty percent seventy percent is is consumer based and in retail
and the consumers have never been in better shape you i know mentioned in my comments just the debt service requirements is fifteen percent of their earnings wage is starting to go up a little bit and we are seeing savings rates go up these are some of the strongest savings rates we have seen in some time i do not know if that is a statement
about confidence or whatever but there is you know it is consumers are benefiting from putting you know filling your tank at the dollar something a gallon or two dollars a gallon versus three or four and not all of it has been spent
and then the last question just give us a sneak preview of the investor conference you know what do you hope to achieve at the investor conference and do you think you will have a director show up again at it well thank you mike for reminding everybody that steve sanger our lead director showed up last time obviously we
we invite our directors and i am give me a chance to invite all of you it is on the twenty fourth of next month it is a tuesday we have an exciting day to share with you we will get fairly granular about how we think about distribution how we think about our businesses it will give us a chance to showcase next generation leaders in the company so we are looking forward to it
we also will think about guardrails around our three big you know metrics we talk about r o a r o e and efficiency ratio i talk about that so it is a bunch of things and also everybody talks about fin tax and clearly
there is a good reason for that i think our company specifically and our industry generally have been innovators for a whole long time so if we were not we would have stage coaches on the freeway right now so we will talk a little bit about that
great thank you thank you mike your next question comes from the line of eric water straw with guggenheim securities please go ahead thanks very much there has been some recent media attention to the buildout you have been doing in some of your advisory and capital markets capacities
and i am wondering what your how you view that now in light of course the broader marketplace for those services which may be under some pressure and then also the fact that your exposure specifically to the energy industry within those business lines is a bit higher than peers is that changing your interest in investment in those
areas you know not really the pattern has been the same since the merger of wells and wachovia to make sure that we have got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of wells fargo who need it we think our risks are well sized we think our
capabilities are well sized as always as you point out there are things to add here and there but from a return point of view from an ability to service our customers point of view we like the trajectory we have taken that is why it is so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something that is not what we need what we
we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers but we are not thinking much differently about it our results frankly were we think they were pretty good in the first quarter as you say we have been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while there will be plenty more
need for that as the industry repairs itself and being in a position to provide that is actually it is good for us we have got industry leading positions in a handful of other industries as well energy is just one of them but like others it is a cyclical business and while it is there is less capital raising going on there right now there is more going on in other spaces and
a lot of advisory work to do so it fits together very nicely with our wholesale bank and is your intent to continue to add personnel into those business lines yeah i think so we are always we are always you know as i say industries come and go with respect to their capital needs and advisory needs and so we want to make sure that we have got the right people in positions to do the right thing we have become an employer of choice for a lot of those activities
activities wells fargo is a very nice place to work we have got a great customer franchise who would not want to work here in those businesses compared to some of the places that they might be coming from and we are always adding good people thanks very much thank you the next question comes from the line of nancy bush with n a b research
please go ahead good morning hey nancy john it kind of got lost in the hoopla yesterday about the living will but there was a reuters news item that says wells fargo has become significantly more important to the health of the global financial system in the past few years says a report by the office of financial research and it strikes me with what came out in the resolution letters
yesterday that maybe being too important to the global financial system may not be an entirely good thing and i am wondering if you feel at this point that your growth or you know lines of business your plans for those might be impacted by this you know these findings
sure so nancy we went and looked at that report after that wacky headline hit the hit the cave and and it reported the same thing it reported a year ago which is that we were number seventeen among g s i b s in the lowest risk category among globally systemically important banks so theres no basis for that story we are a big bank we are globally systemically important and
and we are used to being measured but we ended up toward the bottom of that list so that was a funny conclusion that was drawn with respect to the feedback that we got in the living will there are some actionable things that were going to get right on but there is nothing about
about size about complexity about the nature of our business model about our capital about our liquidity and really it was much more around proper governance and maturation of the process et cetera which are things that are addressable so frankly i do not think we are being criticized by our regulators for the types of things that work their way into the financial press but surely were disappointed in the result and
all hands on deck here and we value the feedback we got from the fed and f d i c and we are committed to have a great submission later this year nancy one thing i would like just to share for a few minutes even though our company has grown
grown significantly organically principally organically over the last seven or eight years we have continued to simplify our business and were and we have shed businesses quietly that either did not have scale for us or provided or had a risk reward
relationship that was not consistent so just let me just check off a few i was just thinking while john was talking we are no longer in the wholesale mortgage business we are not in the joint venture business we are not in the reverse mortgage business we are not in the mortgage consolidation business we have f h a overlays so we are
not as deep in that business as we had been in the past we just sold our r c i s insurance business the direct deposit advance business is no longer here we are not in the government student lending business but a lot are we use it our wells fargo financial business that it is very different today so yes we have grown in deposits and we have grown in
our corporate loans and all and wealth management and all other kind of things that we are involved in but a much simpler company say in many respects now that you have if i may ask you have sort of opened up the living will issue and if i may ask if there are any of this feedback that you got yesterday
that you feel is related to residual issues that are left over from the wachovia deal and i think it i will just say that as an analyst it was no great secret in the industry that they were not the best on the reporting side you know are there any tasks left undone that were related to that merger that may have played
into your feedback yesterday no we own this and we are going to get this right okay if i could ask a totally unrelated question home equity lines of credit seem to be coming back into favor both at the banks and among consumers can you just speak to that business you have always been important in it you know
is it growing now and how do you feel about it because of the starting point that wells fargo has had the numbers have really only been going in one direction which is down down down the product that we have today where we do sell it is an amortizing product right out of the gate so it is very different than it was in the old
days where it was more just incremental leverage that frankly did not come down until it might hit some amortization point in the future so so we certainly offer that amortizing product to our customers but i do not think you will see it make a difference in our reported consumer real estate assets really on our balance sheet it is more about prime jumbo
and non conforming by balance types of loans to prime borrowers okay thank you you are welcome thank you nancy your final question will come from the line of marty mosby with vining sparks thanks john i have done a little bit of the math when you look at the cost of the liabilities on the g e and then the delay in the assets
it looks like from a net n i i standpoint you pick up close to two hundred million dollars as you move into next quarter just from the balance sheet side just trying to piece it together best i could was there any timing effect on the expenses so as you you know came in and brought the operations on board did you have a pretty full run rate on the
expense side versus next quarter so that is my real question is there any you know also leverage in a sense that the expenses were already kind of in place for this quarter going into next quarter right so the big expenses that is the big expense that is related are people expenses the people join the bulk of the people joined on march first so in the last month of the quarter
there are some people in the rail business that joined at the beginning of the year another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we are picking up and they come out of that that begins when the assets are in place but importantly one of the reasons that we are describing this as modestly accretive in the year is there is a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur including what we are paying for transition services that we are still getting
from g e that will shift over to wells fargo at some point in the future very different points in the future and then there is technology work to do there is some loan file work to do some paperwork to do there is a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets wells fargo assets in the regulated environment that we are operating in and we will pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that so i would be hesitant to offer you
up a run rate from march that reflects what q two or the rest of the year is going to look like would you be on the expense side isolating those as integration costs so we can you know know not the total but just as integration like you would do with any other kind of merger and then when we look at the seasonal uptick that we have
in the kind of those employee related expenses typically you do not see kind of a net benefit as it goes down because there is other expenses that offset that but would you expect in the core expenses to see somewhat of a roll down given the how high the seasonal expenses were this first quarter
so just you know two things on that side yeah well i expect that we will be between fifty five percent and fifty nine percent in our efficiency ratio for the rest of the year on the high side of that and that would capture the change in seasonal expenses it is a good point that not all of that seasonal comp expense disappears and that the whole net benefit does not come back we call out in our deck but there are some other things that are seasonally depressed in the first
quarter that pick up in the second quarter not as big but that are seasonal in that way and you know we will see how material it is but if it becomes appropriate to provide clarity on the g e transition related expenses we might consider calling that out
if but we have not begun to yet because we are still developing those expenses we are still coming into we are the early stage of execution on some of the technology oriented things that i mentioned and some other chunky early expenses that will start to run off after a bit
and then john lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit is as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption were you kind of thinking in a sense i have this gain over here i do not really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of what is going on in the market that gives me some of
breathing room to kind of see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter you know recreating the income that you gave up in the first quarter you know investing in risk in relatively risk free assets does not produce that much p and l in the quarter that we invest so
so there really was not much of a trade off in the first quarter between the gain that reflects this business that we agreed to sell a few quarters ago that closed this quarter it is really the threshold issues on reinvestment are more around our capital sensitivity because were going to be living with the valuation consequences of buying duration at a low rate low yield entry point
and that really is more where the trade off occurred so thinking about the whole year impact maybe on interest income but also our o c i sensitivity if rates ultimately back up thanks yup okay thank you all for joining us and also i want to say thank you to our two hundred and sixty eight thousand team members for serving our customers and producing five and a half billion dollars of quarterly
