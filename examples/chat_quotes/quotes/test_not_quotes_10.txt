in addition i want to call your attention to the fact that we added accelerated stock based compensation to our guidance we expect to recognize its r rated stock based compensation expense on a quarterly bases totaling one million dollars for the full year this expense is expected to be reported in compensation and benefits and included in our non gap reconciliation as an adjusted financial measure
