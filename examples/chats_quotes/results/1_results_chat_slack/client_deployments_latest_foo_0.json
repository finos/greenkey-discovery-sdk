We've added several missing structures and about 130 new test cases to our code base. Further, we've standardized our abbreviation for year in the output to be 'y' instead of 'yr'. These fixes should be deployed tomorrow during Gagan's on site visit.\n\nThere are a few examples from the test cases that remain somewhat unclear to us that we'd like to support after getting more detail around them. I enumerate the unclear structures below.\n\n---\nTRANSCRIPT 'can you please show me sep nineteen by fifteenth may twenty four euro sixes in thirty k d v oh one'\nIMSTRING   'EUR u19 x 15/May/24 v6m in 30K DV01'\n\nIs this a hedge?

What are the rules around this structure?\n\n--- \n\nTRANSCRIPT 'forty five million june immy two years standard rolls at zero percent versus uh four point five million june immy ten years at one percent'\nIMSTRING   '45MM Jun IMM 2y std rolls 0.0% vs 4.5MM Jun IMM 10y 1.00%'\n\nIs this another instance we found where a rate is used for each leg of a trade? What are the rules around when rates can go with a leg?\n\nAlso, are these notionals used instead of pricing?\n---\n\nTRANSCRIPT 'h thirty nine twenty five k euro in oh one'\nIMSTRING   'H/39 25K EUR DV01'\n\nWhat's the implied product here?\n```",
