commitment that is how the process works in the quarter there were some of these what you might characterize as defensive draws that we have observed not that many of them you can see the increase in the total outstanding s in oil and gas rose by about four hundred million dollars and about half of that was from frankly leases that we picked up from ge that have a credit mark in them incidentally so it really did not amount to that much but it is a phenomenon that we have seen that we have read about it is not having that big of an impact today but we do think that were capturing that risk as we assess what the appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in the space so when i guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded how does that transition from unfunded funded impact your allowance i guess i think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitment is lower than it is on funded commitments but just trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of shifting from one bucket to the other so in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our whether we consider a borrower relationship to be non performing or what status were marking at were imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure at default would be if it is meaning that it could be greater than the currently outstanding amount that is part of the loan by loan process analysis by analysis that we do when building it when rewriting loans every quarter and building up for the allowance so there is some estimation of what today is currently unfunded will become funded in the future thank you and if i can just ask a final follow up can you discuss the methodology underlying your energy reserve is it based more on the ability of borrowers to repay
