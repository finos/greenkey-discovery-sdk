# This Yaml assembles a list of entities that are seen in the 'old interpreters'  (projects/discovery/src/interpreters_old/)
# entities for one interpreter can be used from another (egbs may use entities from credit)

## entities for class_credit.py
entities:
  - credit_product:
    - file: "credit_products.txt"

  - upcoming_year:
    - "%num{1,6}"
    - validation: "is_upcoming_year.py"  ( datetime.now.year() < x < datetime.now.year() + 10 , x is an int)
  
  - coupon:
    - "%num{1,6}? %spot? %num{1,6}?"
    - validation: "lambda x: 0 < x < 20"  ( x is a float, not a string )
  
  - credit_instrument:
    - "%credit_product %coupon? %upcoming_year?"
    


## entities for class_egbs.py
## Matthew: we do not want to use fuzzy matching anymore in discovery. the confusion matrix is used instead
## class_egbs.py contained 13 QuoteStructures (2 of those are hedges)
