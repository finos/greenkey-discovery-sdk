The Discovery SDK allows you to write logic-based interpreters, and let GreenKey's Discovery engine use machine learning to identify intents and extract entities.

You can use your Discovery interpreter to power several voice- and chat-driven workflows

- Building a skill in combination with [Scribe's Real-Time Dictation](https://docs.greenkeytech.com/audio/#audioserver)

- Searching transcribed files for key phrases with [Scribe's File Transcription](https://docs.greenkeytech.com/audio/#fileserver)

- Powering chat-bot workflows using [Discovery as a service](https://docs.greenkeytech.com/nlp/#discovery)

Read more about Discovery on our [blog](https://greenkeytech.com/greenkey-scribe-discovery-skills/) or [checkout the full documentation](https://github.com/finos/greenkey-discovery-sdk/wiki)

The GreenKey Discovery SDK
is hosted by the [Voice Program] of the Fintech Open Source Foundation ([FINOS]).

open standards, interoperability, and innovation in the financial services sector,

# Overview
1. [Quickstart](#1-quickstart)
    - Step through the 'digit' interpreter example.

2. [Customization](#2-customization)
    - Customize your own interpreter.

3. [Deploying](#3-deploying)
    - Transcribing voice audio files with Scribe and using the Discovery engine.


# 1. Quickstart

## Requirements

- Docker 17+ (or Discovery Binaries)
- Python 3 with `pip`

## Dependencies

To ensure your dependencies install correctly, we recommend that you upgrade your `setuptools` before proceeding further.

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

Now you are ready to install the required dependencies with `pip`.
This will provide you with the packages needed to run the `test_discovery.py` script (see the 'digit' example below), as well as the Discovery CLI.

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Obtaining Credentials
[Contact us](mailto:transcription@greenkeytech.com) to obtain credentials to obtain the Discovery Docker container from our repository and launch the Discovery engine.


## Discovery Examples Directory Overview
Each discovery example contains a folder named `custom`, which in turn contains the required `definitions.yaml` file.
Some examples contain a `schemas` key in the `definitions.yaml` file to customize the return json.
They also contain example scripts to see how the particular configuration will detect entities.

```
examples
└── digit
    ├── custom
    │   └── definitions.yaml
    ├── send_transcript_to_discovery.sh
    └── tests.txt
```

## The 'digit' Interpreter Example
1) Test cases for the room dialing example are in `examples/digit/tests.txt`

```
intent_whitelist: digit

test: dial number
transcript: please dial eight
room_number: 8

test: dial number
transcript: press one eight
room_number: 1
...
```

2) The definition file, `examples/digit/custom/definitions.yaml`, contains examples that match the tests

```
entities:
  room_number:
    - "@num"
intents:
  digit:
    examples:
      - "please select @num to speak to the operator"
      - "to change your order press @room_number"
      - "if this is an emergency dial @room_number"
      - "for animal control services press @room_number"
```

where "digit" is the name of the intent and the entities value ("room_number") match entities in `tests.txt`.


# 2. Customization

Creating a custom project can be done by following the structure of an existing example found in the `examples` folder. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/finos/greenkey-discovery-sdk/wiki) for further information on customization


# 3. Deploying

Check out our deployment [documentation](https://docs.greenkeytech.com/nlp/#discovery) for full details on deploying Discovery.
